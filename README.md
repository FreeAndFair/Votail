The Votail verified PR-STV tally system.

Votail is an open source Java implementation of Ireland's method of
Proportional Representation by Single Transferable Vote (PRSTV). The
functional requirements derived from Irish electoral law are specified
using Business Object Notation (BON) and the Java Modeling Language
(JML). Formal methods have been used to verify the correctness of the
software.
