    NEWS.txt file for JML and the Common (formerly ISU) JML Tools

New with release 5.6_rc2 (May 20, 2008)

   major improvements:

     - Addition of jmle, which is a tool for executing JML
       specifications.  This can be used to validate specifications,
       to debug them, and to allow specifications to serve as
       prototypes.  The jmle tool generates Java code, so it can be
       used as with any other Java code, in particular with JUnit unit
       testing.  For more information see the README.txt file in the
       org/jmlspecs/jmlexec directory or the paper
       by Krause and Wahls "jmle: A Tool for Executing JML
       Specifications via Constraint Programming" at 
       http://users.dickinson.edu/~wahlst/papers/tool.pdf
       Thanks to Tim Wahls.

   minor improvements:

     - The ant tasks for JML are back in the jml-release.jar file.

     - Updates to the Universe type system, including support for
       Generic Universe types. The largest visible change
       is the improved defaulting of the ownership modifiers, which is
       now described in the JML Reference manual. Also
       multi-dimensional arays of primitive types can now take two
       ownership modifiers. Thanks to Werner Dietl.

     - Various fixes to the Universe type system annotations for the
       JDK (and the JML tools), thanks to Werner Dietl.

     - A temporary fix to bug #1961579, thanks to Tim Wahls and Werner
       Dietl for help on this.

     - Various fixes to the JML Reference Manual, thanks to Patrice
       Chalin, Jooyong Lee, and Dan Zimmerman.  In particular
       clarifications in the sections on quantifiers and set
       comprehensions to better describe some of the semantics and
       simplify the set comprehension grammar.
