<BLOCKQUOTE>
JML is a behavioral interface specification language tailored
to Java.
It is designed to be written and read by working software engineers,
and should require only modest mathematical training.
It uses Eiffel-style syntax
combined with model-based semantics, as in VDM and Larch.
JML supports quantifiers, specification-only variables,
and other enhancements
that make it more expressive for specification than Eiffel
and easier to use than VDM and Larch.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

JML <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB20">[Leavens-Baker-Ruby01]</A>, which stands for "Java Modeling Language,"
is a behavioral interface specification language (BISL)
<A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB35">[Wing87]</A>
designed to specify
Java <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB1">[Arnold-Gosling98]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB7">[Gosling-Joy-Steele96]</A> 
modules.
Java <EM>modules</EM> are classes and interfaces.
</P><P>

A <EM>behavioral interface specification</EM> describes both the
details of a module's interface with clients,
and its behavior from the client's point of view.
Such specifications are not good for the specification of whole programs,
but are good for recording
detailed design decisions or documentation of intended behavior,
for a software module.
</P><P>

The goal of this chapter is to explain JML and the concepts behind
its approach to specification.
Since JML is used in detailed design of Java modules,
we use the detailed design of an interface and class for
priority queues as an example.
The rest of this section explains interfaces
and behavioral interface specification.
In the next section we describe how to specify new types
as conceptual models for detailed design.
Following that we finish the example by giving the details
of a class specification.
We conclude after mentioning some other features of JML.

<H2> 1.1 Interfaces </H2>
<!--docid::SEC2::-->
<P>

A module's <EM>interface</EM> consists of its name,
and the names and types of its fields and methods.
Java interfaces declare such interface information,
but class declarations do as well.
As in the Larch family of BISLs
<A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB6">[Guttag-Horning93]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB17">[LeavensLarchFAQ]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB35">[Wing87]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB36">[Wing90a]</A>,
interface information in JML
is declared using the declaration syntax of the programming language
to which the BISL is tailored;
thus, JML uses Java declaration syntax.
</P><P>

An example is given in the file
<TT>`PriorityQueueUser.java-refined'</TT>, which is shown below.
This example gives the information a Java program needs
to use a <CODE>PriorityQueueUser</CODE> object,
including the package to which it belongs, the accessibility of the
methods (<CODE>public</CODE>), the names of the methods,
the types of their arguments and results, and what
exceptions they can throw.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlkluwer;
public interface PriorityQueueUser {
 /*@ pure @*/ boolean contains(Object argObj);
 /*@ pure @*/ Object next() throws PQException;
 void remove(Object argObj);
 /*@ pure @*/ boolean isEmpty();
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Also included in the above file are three JML <EM>annotations</EM>.
These annotations are enclosed within these annotation comments
of the form <CODE>/*@</CODE> <small>...</small> <CODE>@*/</CODE>;
one can also write annotation comments using the form <CODE>//@</CODE>,
and such comments extend to the end of the corresponding line.<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="jmlkluwer_fot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>
Java ignores both kinds of JML annotation comments,
but they are significant to JML.
The <CODE>pure</CODE> annotations on the methods <CODE>next</CODE>,
<CODE>contains</CODE>, and <CODE>isEmpty</CODE> require these methods to be
<EM>pure</EM>, meaning that they cannot have any side effects.
</P><P>

<A NAME="A First Example of Behavioral Specification"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC3"></A>
<H2> 1.2 A First Example of Behavioral Specification </H2>
<!--docid::SEC3::-->
<P>

In JML, behavioral specification information is also given in the form
of annotations.
As in the Larch approach, such specifications are model-based.
That is, they are stated in terms of a mathematical model
<A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB6">[Guttag-Horning93]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB8">[Hoare72a]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB34">[Wing83]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB35">[Wing87]</A>
of the states (or values) of objects.
Unlike most Larch-style specification languages, however,
in JML such models are described by declaring <EM>model fields</EM>,
which are only used for purposes of specification.
In JML, a declaration can include the modifier <CODE>model</CODE>,
which means that the declaration need not appear in a correct implementation;
all non-model declarations must appear in a correct implementation.
</P><P>

As an example, the file <TT>`PriorityQueueUser.jml-refined'</TT> below
specifies a model for priority queues.
This specification is a refinement of the one
given in the file (shown above) <TT>`PriorityQueueUser.java-refined'</TT>,
which is why the <CODE>refine</CODE> clause appears in the specification
following the <CODE>package</CODE> declaration.
The meaning of the <CODE>refine</CODE> clause is that the given specification adds
to the one in the file named, by imposing additional constraints
on that specification.
Such a refinement might be done,
for example, when one is starting to make detailed design decisions
or when starting to specify the behavior of existing software modules.
In a refinement, existing specification information is inherited;
that is, the method declarations in the interface <CODE>PriorityQueueUser</CODE>
are inherited, and thus not
repeated below.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlkluwer;

//@ refine "PriorityQueueUser.java-refined";
//@ model import org.jmlspecs.models.*;

public interface PriorityQueueUser {

 /*@ public model instance JMLValueSet entries;
   @ public initially entries.isEmpty();
   @*/
 /*@ public instance invariant
   @      (\forall JMLType e; entries.has(e);
   @                           e instanceof QueueEntry);
   @ public instance invariant
   @   (\forall QueueEntry e1; entries.has(e1);
   @       (\forall QueueEntry e2;
   @         entries.has(e2) &#38;&#38; !(e1.equals(e2));
   @           e2.obj != e1.obj
   @           &#38;&#38; e2.timeStamp != e1.timeStamp ) );
   @*/
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Following the <CODE>refine</CODE> clause above is a <CODE>model import</CODE> declaration.
This has the effect like a Java <CODE>import</CODE> declaration for JML,
but the use of <CODE>model</CODE> means
that the import does not have to appear
in an implementation, as it is only needed for specification purposes.
The package being imported, <CODE>org.jmlspecs.models</CODE>,
consists of several pure classes including sets, sequences, relations,
maps, and so on, which are useful in behavioral specification.
These fill the role of the built-in types used for specification in VDM and Z,
or the traits used in Larch.
Since they are pure (side-effect free) classes,
they can be used in assertions without affecting the state of
the computation, which allows assertions to have a well-defined
mathematical meaning (unlike Eiffel's assertions).
However, since they are Java classes, their methods are invoked using
the usual Java syntax.
</P><P>

In the specification above we use the class <CODE>JMLValueSet</CODE>
as the type of the model field <CODE>entries</CODE>.
That is, for purposes of specification, we imagine that every
object that implements the interface <CODE>PriorityQueueUser</CODE>
has a public field <CODE>entries</CODE> of type <CODE>JMLValueSet</CODE>.
This model field appears (to clients) to have started out initially
as empty, as stated in the <CODE>initially</CODE> clause
attached to its declaration
<A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB27">[Ogden-etal94]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB25">[Morgan94]</A>.
</P><P>

The two <CODE>invariant</CODE> clauses further describe the intended state
of <CODE>entries</CODE>.
The first states that all of its elements
have type <CODE>QueueEntry</CODE>.
(By default JML implicitly adds an invariant that <CODE>entries</CODE> 
is non-null <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB3">[Chalin-Rioux05]</A>.)
</P><P>

The <CODE>\forall</CODE> notation is an addition to the Java syntax for
expressions; it gives universal quantification over the declared variables.
Within such an expression of the form <CODE>(\forall T x; R(x); P(x))</CODE>,
the expression <CODE>R(x)</CODE> specifies the <EM>range</EM> over which the bound
variable, <CODE>x</CODE>, can take on values; it is separated from the
<EM>term</EM> predicate, <CODE>P(x)</CODE>, by a semicolon (<CODE>;</CODE>).
For example, the first invariant means that for all
<CODE>JMLType</CODE> objects <CODE>e</CODE> such that <CODE>entries.has(e)</CODE>,
<CODE>e</CODE> has type <CODE>QueueEntry</CODE>.
The second invariant states that every such <CODE>QueueEntry</CODE> object
has a unique <CODE>obj</CODE> and <CODE>timeStamp</CODE>.
</P><P>

In the file <TT>`PriorityQueueUser.java'</TT> below
we make yet another refinement,
to specify the behavior of the methods of <CODE>PriorityQueueUser</CODE>.
This specification, because it refines the
specification in <TT>`PriorityQueueUser.jml-refined'</TT>,
inherits the model fields specified there, as well as the <CODE>initially</CODE>
and <CODE>invariant</CODE> clauses.
(Inheritance of specifications is explained further below.)

</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The specification of <CODE>contains</CODE> above shows the simplest form of a
behavioral specification for a method:
a single <CODE>public normal_behavior</CODE> clause
followed by a method header.
This specification says that the method
returns true just when its argument is the same as some object in the queue.
The <CODE>public normal_behavior</CODE> clause in this specification
consists of a single <CODE>ensures</CODE> clause.
This <CODE>ensures</CODE> clause gives the method's total-correctness
postcondition;
that is, calls to <CODE>contains</CODE> must terminate
(as opposed to looping forever or aborting)
in a state that satisfies the postcondition.
The <CODE>public</CODE> keyword says that the specification is intended for clients;
while the "normal" in <CODE>normal_behavior</CODE> prohibits throwing exceptions.
The meaning of <CODE>&#38;&#38;</CODE> and <CODE>==</CODE> are as in Java;
that is, <CODE>&#38;&#38;</CODE> is short-circuit logical conjunction,
and <CODE>e.obj == argObj</CODE> means that <CODE>e.obj</CODE> and <CODE>argObj</CODE>
are the same object.
The keyword <CODE>\result</CODE> denotes the return value of the method,
which in this case is a boolean.
The operator <CODE>&#60;==&#62;</CODE> means "if and only if";
it is equivalent to <CODE>==</CODE> for booleans, but has a lower precedence.
The notation <CODE>\exists</CODE> is used for existential quantification.
Like universal quantifiers,
existential quantifiers can also have a range expression
that is separated from the term expression by a semicolon (<CODE>;</CODE>).
</P><P>

The specification of the method <CODE>next</CODE> shows one way to specify
methods with exceptions in JML.
This uses a <CODE>public normal_behavior</CODE> clause for the case where no
exceptions are thrown, and an <CODE>public exceptional_behavior</CODE>
clause for when exceptions are thrown.
The semantics is that a correct implementation must satisfy
both of these behaviors <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB19">[Leavens-Baker99]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB37">[Wills94]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB34">[Wing83]</A>.
In the specification of <CODE>next</CODE>,
the <CODE>public exceptional_behavior</CODE> clause states that
only an instance of the <CODE>PQException</CODE> class
(not shown here) may be thrown when <CODE>entries</CODE> is empty.
The <CODE>requires</CODE> clause gives a precondition for that case,
and when it is true, the method must terminate
(in this case by throwing an exception).
Since no other exceptions are allowed, this effectively says that the
method must thorw an instance of <CODE>PQException</CODE> when the
exceptional behavior's precondition is satisfied by a call.
as that case's postcondition must be satisfied.
</P><P>

The public normal behavior of <CODE>next</CODE> must be obeyed
when its precondition is true;
that is, when <CODE>entries</CODE> is not empty.
The normal behavior's postcondition
says that <CODE>next</CODE> returns an object with the lowest timestamp
in the highest priority level.
</P><P>

It would, of course, be possible to only specify the public normal behavior
for <CODE>next</CODE>.  If this were done,
then implementations could just assume the precondition of
the normal behavior--that <CODE>entries</CODE> is not empty.
That would be an appropriate design for clients that can be trusted,
and might permit more efficient implementation.
The given specification is appropriate for untrusted clients
<A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB23">[Meyer92a]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB26">[Meyer97]</A>.
</P><P>

The specification <CODE>remove</CODE> uses case analysis
<A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB19">[Leavens-Baker99]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB37">[Wills94]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB34">[Wing83]</A>
in the specification of normal behavior.
The two cases are separated by the keyword <CODE>also</CODE>,
and each must be obeyed when its precondition is true.
The first case contains a <CODE>assignable</CODE> clause.<A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="jmlkluwer_fot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>
This is a frame condition
<A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB2">[Borgida-Mylopoulos-Reiter95]</A>;
it states that only the fields mentioned
(and any on which they depend <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB14">[Leino95]</A> <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB13">[Leino95a]</A>)
can be assigned to; no other fields, including fields in other objects,
can be assigned.
Omitting the <CODE>assignable</CODE> clause means that all fields
can be assigned.
(Technically, the assignable clause is also concerned with array elements.
Local variables, including the formal parameters of a method,
and also fields of newly-created objects may also be
freely assigned by a method <A HREF="jmlkluwer_7.html#BIB20">[Leavens-Baker-Ruby01]</A>.)
Note that the precondition of <CODE>remove</CODE> uses the method <CODE>contains</CODE>,
which is permitted because it is pure.
</P><P>

The most interesting thing about the specification of <CODE>remove</CODE>
is that it uses the JML reserved word <CODE>\old</CODE>.
As in Eiffel,
the meaning of <CODE>\old(</CODE><I>E</I><CODE>)</CODE> is as if <I>E</I> were evaluated
in the pre-state and that value is used in place of
<CODE>\old(</CODE><I>E</I><CODE>)</CODE> in the assertion.
</P><P>

While we have broken up the specification of <CODE>PriorityQueueUser</CODE>
into three pieces, that was done partly to demonstrate refinement and partly
so that each piece would fit on a page.
In common use, this specification would be written in one file.
