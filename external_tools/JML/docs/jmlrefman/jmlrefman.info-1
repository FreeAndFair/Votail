1 Introduction
**************

JML is a notation for formally specifying the behavior and interfaces
of Java [Arnold-Gosling-Holmes00] [Gosling-etal00] classes and methods.

   The goal of this reference manual is to precisely record the design
of JML.  We include both informal semantics (intentions) and where
possible [[[we will eventually include]]] formal semantics (describing
when an implementation satisfies a specification). We also discuss the
implications for various tools (such as the run-time assertion checker,
static checkers such as ESC/Java2, and documentation generators such as
jmldoc [Burdy-etal03]).

   In this manual we also try to give examples and explanations, and we
hope that these will be helpful to readers trying to learn about formal
specification using JML.  However, this manual is not designed to give
all the background needed to write JML specifications, nor to give the
prospective user an overview of a useful subset of the language.  For
this background, we recommend starting with the papers "Design by
Contract with JML" [Leavens-Cheon06] and "JML: A notation for detailed
design" [Leavens-Baker-Ruby99], and continuing with the paper
"Preliminary Design of JML" [Leavens-Baker-Ruby06].  These are all
available from the JML web site `http://www.jmlspecs.org/', where
further readings and examples may also be found.

   Readers with the necessary background, and users wanting more
details may, we hope, profit from reading this manual.  We suggest
reading this manual starting with chapters 1-3, skimming chapter 4
quickly, skimming chapter 5 to get the idea of what declarations mean
in JML, and then reading the chapters on class specifications (chapter
6) and method specifications (chapter 7), paying particular attention
to the examples.  After that, one can use the rest of this manual as a
reference.

   The rest of this chapter describes some of the fundamental ideas and
background behind JML.

1.1 Behavioral Interface Specifications
=======================================

JML is a "behavioral interface specification language" (BISL) that
builds on the Larch approach [Guttag-Horning93] [Guttag-Horning-Wing85b]
and that found in APP [Rosenblum95] and Eiffel [Meyer92b] [Meyer97].
In this style of specification, which might be called model-oriented
[Wing90a], one specifies both the interface of a method or abstract
data type and its behavior [Lamport89].  In particular JML builds on
the work done by Leavens and others in Larch/C++ [Leavens-Baker99]
[Leavens96b] [Leavens97c].  (Indeed, large parts of this manual are
adapted wholesale from the Larch/C++ reference manual [Leavens97c].)
Much of JML's design was heavily influenced by the work of Leino and his
collaborators [Leino95] [Leino95b] [Leino98] [Leino-etal00]
[Leino-Nelson-Saxe00].  JML continues to be influenced by ongoing work
in formal specification and verification.  A collection of papers
relating directly to JML and its design is found at
`http://www.jmlspecs.org/papers.shtml'.

   The "interface" of the method or type is the information needed to
use it from other programs.  In the case of JML, this is the Java
syntax and type information needed to call a method or use a field or
type.  For a method the interface includes such things as the name of
the method, its modifiers (including its visibility and whether it is
final) its number of arguments, its return type, what exceptions it may
throw, and so on.  For a field the interface includes its name and
type, and its modifiers.  For a type, the interface includes its name,
its modifiers, its package, whether it is a class or interface, its
supertypes, and the interfaces of the fields and methods it declares
and inherits.  JML specifies all such interface information using
Java's syntax.

   A "behavior" of a method or type describes a set of state
transformations that it can perform.  A behavior of a method is
specified by describing: a set of states in which calling the method is
defined, a set of locations that the method is allowed to assign to
(and hence change), and the relations between the calling state and the
state in which it either returns normally, throws an exception, or for
which it might not return to the caller.  The states for which the
method is defined are formally described by a logical assertion, called
the method's "precondition".  The allowed relationships between these
states and the states that may result from normal return are formally
described by another logical assertion called the method's "normal
postcondition".  Similarly the relationships between these pre-states
and the states that may result from throwing an exception are described
by the method's "exceptional postcondition".  The states for which the
method need not return to the caller are described by the method's
"divergence condition"; however, explicit specification of divergence
is rarely used in JML.  The set of locations the method is allowed to
assign to is described by the method's "frame axiom" [Borgida-etal95].
In JML one can also specify other aspects of behavior, such as the time
a method can use to execute and the space it may need.

   The behavior of an abstract data type (ADT), which is implemented by
a class in Java, is specified by describing a set of abstract fields for
its objects and by specifying the behavior of its methods (as described
above).  The abstract fields for an object can be specified either by
using JML's model and ghost fields [Cheon-etal05], which are
specification-only fields, or by specifying some of the fields used in
the implementation as `spec_public' or `spec_protected'.  These
declarations allow the specifier using JML to model an instance as a
collection of abstract instance variables, in much the same way as
other specification languages, such as Z [Hayes93] [Spivey92] or Fresco
[Wills92b].

1.2 A First Example
===================

For example, consider the following JML specification of a simple Java
abstract class `IntHeap'. (An explanation of the notation follows the
specification.  This specification, like the others in this manual,
ships with the JML release in the `JML/org/jmlspecs/samples/jmlrefman'
directory.)

     package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;               // line 1
                                                           // line 2
     public abstract class IntHeap {                       // line 3
                                                           // line 4
         //@ public model non_null int [] elements;        // line 5
                                                           // line 6
         /*@ public normal_behavior                        // line 7
           @   requires elements.length >= 1;              // line 8
           @   assignable \nothing;                        // line 9
           @   ensures \result                             // line 10
           @        == (\max int j;                        // line 11
           @               0 <= j && j < elements.length;  // line 12
           @               elements[j]);                   // line 13
           @*/                                             // line 14
         public abstract /*@ pure @*/ int largest();       // line 15
                                                           // line 16
         //@ ensures \result == elements.length;           // line 17
         public abstract /*@ pure @*/ int size();          // line 18
     };                                                    // line 19

   The interface of this class consists of lines 1, 3, 15, and 18.
Line 3 specifies the class name, and the fact that the class is both
public and abstract. Lines 15 and 18, apart from their comments, give
the interface information for the methods of this class.

   The behavior of this class is specified in the JML annotations found
in the special comments that have an at-sign (`@') as their first
character following the usual comment beginning.  Such lines look like
comments to Java, but are interpreted by JML and its tools.  For
example, line 5 starts with an annotation comment marker of the form
`//@', and this annotation continues until the `//' towards the end of
the line, which starts a comment within the annotation which even JML
ignores.  The other form of such annotations can be seen on lines 7
through 14, line 17, and on lines 15 and 18.  These annotations start
with the characters `/*@' and end with either `@*/' or `*/'; within
such annotations, at-signs (`@') at the beginnings of lines are ignored
by JML.  Note that there can be no space between the start of comment
marker, either `//' or `/*' and the first at-sign; thus `// @' starts a
comment, not an annotation.  (*Note Lexical Conventions::, for more
details about annotations.)

   The first annotation, on line 5 of the figure above, gives the
specification of a field, named `elements', which is part of this
class's behavioral specification.  Ignoring, for the moment the extra
JML modifiers, one should think of this field, in essence, as being
declared like:
        public int[] elements;
   That is, it is a public field with an integer array type; within
specifications it is treated as such.  However, because it is declared
in an annotation, this field cannot be manipulated by Java code.
Therefore, for example, the fact that the field is declared public is
not a problem, because it cannot be directly changed by Java code.

   Such declarations of fields in annotations should be marked as
specification-only fields, using the JML modifier `model'.(1) A model
field should be thought of as an abstraction of a set of concrete
fields used in the implementation of this type and its subtypes.
(*Note Represents Clauses::, for a discussion of how to specify the
connection between the concrete fields and such model fields.  See also
the paper by Cheon et al. [Cheon-etal05].) That is, we imagine that
objects that are instances of the type `IntHeap' have such a field,
whose value is determined by the concrete fields that are known to Java
in the actual object.  Of course at runtime, objects of type `IntHeap'
have no such field, the model fields are purely imaginary.  Model
fields are thus a convenient fiction that is useful for describing the
behavior of an ADT.  One does not have to worry about their cost (in
space or time), and should only be concerned with how they clarify the
behavior of an ADT.

   The other annotation used on line 5 is `non_null'.  This just says
that in any publicly-visible state, the value of `elements' must not be
`null'.  It is thus a simple kind of invariant (*note Invariants::).

   In the above specification of `IntHeap', the specification of each
method precedes its interface declaration.  This follows the usual
convention of Java tools, such as JavaDoc, which put such descriptive
information in front of the method.  In JML, it is also possible to put
the specification just before the semicolon (`;') following the
method's interface information (*note Method Specifications::), but we
will usually not to do that in this document.

   The specification of the method `largest' is given on lines 7
through 15. Line 7 says that this is a public, normal behavior
specification.  JML permits several different specifications for a
given method, which can be of different privacy levels [Ruby-Leavens00]
[Leavens-Mueller07].  The modifier `public' says that the specification
is intended for use by clients.  (If the privacy modifier had been
`protected', for example, then the specification would have been
intended for subclasses.)

   The keyword `normal_behavior' tells JML several things.  First, it
says that the specification is a heavyweight method specification, as
opposed to a lightweight method specification like that given on line
17.  A "heavyweight" specification uses one of JML's behavior keywords,
like `normal_behavior', which tells JML that the method specification
is intended to be complete.  By contrast, a "lightweight" specification
does not use one of JML's behavior keywords, and tells JML that the
specification is incomplete in the sense that it contains only some of
what the specifier had in mind.(2) Second, the keyword
`normal_behavior' tells JML that when the precondition of this method
is met, then the method must return normally, without throwing an
exception. In other words, it says that the exceptional postcondition
is `false', which prohibits the method from throwing an exception when
the precondition holds.  (Third, it says that the divergence condition
defaults to `false'.  *Note Method Specifications::, for more details.)

   The heart of the method specification of `largest' is found on lines
7 through 13.  This part of the specification gives the method's
precondition, on line 8, frame axiom, on line 9, and normal
postcondition, on lines 10 through 13.  The precondition is contained
in the `requires' clause on line 8.  The frame axiom is contained in the
`assignable' clause on line 9.  The normal postcondition is contained
in the `ensures' clause on lines 10-13.(3)[[[Doesn't this paragraph
just duplicate what has already been said - DRC]]]

   The precondition in the requires clause on line 8 says that the
length of `elements' must be at least 1 before this method can be
called.  If that is not true, then the method is under no obligation to
fulfill the rest of the specified behavior.

   The frame axiom in the assignable clause on line 9 says that the
method may not assign to any locations (i.e. fields of objects) that
are visible outside the method and which existed before the method
started execution.  (The method may still modify its local variables.)
This form of the frame axiom is quite common.(4) Note that in
assignable clauses and in assertions, JML uses keywords that start with
a backslash (`\'), to avoid interfering with identifiers in the user's
program.  Examples of this are `\nothing' on line 9 and `\result' on
line 10.

   The postcondition in the ensures clause, on lines 10 through 13,
says that the result of the method (`\result') must be equal to the
maximum integer found in the array `elements'.  This postcondition uses
JML's `\max' quantifier (lines 11 through 13).  Such a quantifier is
always parenthesized, and can consist of three parts.  The first part
of a quantifier is a declaration of some quantified variables, in this
case the integer `j' on line 11.  The second part is a "range
predicate", on line 12, which constrains the quantified variables.  The
third part is the "body" of the quantifier, on line 13, which in this
case describes the elements of the array from which the maximum value
is taken.

   The methods `largest' and `size' are both specified using the JML
modifier `pure'.  This modifier says that the method has no side
effects, and allows the method to be used in assertions if desired.

   The method `size' is specified using a lightweight specification,
which is given on line 17.  The ensures clause on line 17 says nothing
about the precondition, frame axiom, exceptional postcondition, or
divergence condition of `size', although the use of `pure' on line 18
gives an implicit frame axiom.  Such a form of specification is useful
when one only cares to state (the important) part of a method's
specification.  It is also useful when first learning JML, and when one
is using tools, such as ESC/Java2, that do not need heavyweight
specifications.

   The specifications of the method `largest' above is very precise: it
gives a complete specification of what the method does.  Even the
specification of `size' has a fairly complete normal postcondition.  We
can also give JML specifications that are far less detailed.  For
example, we could just specify that the result of `size' is
non-negative, with a normal postcondition such as
      //@ ensures \result >= 0;
   instead of the postcondition given earlier.  Such incomplete
specifications give considerably more freedom to implementations, and
can often be useful for hiding implementation details.  However, one
should try to write specifications that capture the important
properties expected of callers (preconditions) and implementations
(postconditions) [Meyer92a] [Liskov-Guttag86].

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is the usual way to declare a specification-only field; it
is also possible to use the `ghost' modifier (*note Model and Ghost::).

   (2) Lightweight specifications come from ESC/Java.

   (3) JML also has various synonyms for these keywords; one can use
`pre' for `requires', `modifies' or `modifiable' for `assignable', and
`post' for `ensures' if desired.  *Note Method Specifications::, for
more details.

   (4) However, unlike Larch BISLs and earlier versions of JML, this is
not the default for an omitted `assignable' clause (*note Assignable
Clauses::).  Thus line 9 cannot be omitted without changing the meaning
of the specification.

1.3 What is JML Good For?
=========================

JML is a formal specification language tailored to Java.  Its basic use
is thus the formal specification of the behavior of Java program
modules.  As it is a behavioral interface specification language, JML
specifies how to use such Java program modules from _within_ a Java
program; hence JML is _not_ designed for specifying the behavior of an
entire program.  So the question "what is JML good for?" really boils
down to the following question: what good is formal specification for
Java program modules?

   The two main benefits in using JML are:
   * the precise, unambiguous specification of the behavior of Java
     program modules (i.e., classes and interfaces), and documentation
     of Java code,

   * the possibility of tool support [Burdy-etal03].

   Although we would like tools that would help with reasoning about
concurrent aspects of Java programs, the current version of JML focuses
on the sequential behavior of Java code.  While there is work in
progress on extending JML to support concurrency, the current version
of JML does not have features that help specify how Java threads
interact with each other.  JML does not, for example, allow the
specification of elaborate temporal properties, such as coordinated
access to shared variables or the absence of deadlock.  Indeed, we
assume, in the rest of this manual, that there is only one thread of
execution in a Java program annotated with JML, and we focus on how the
program manipulates object states.  To summarize, JML is currently
limited to sequential specification; we say that JML specifies the
"sequential behavior" of Java program modules.

   In terms of detailed design documentation, a JML specification can
be a completely formal contract about an interface and its sequential
behavior.  Because it is an interface specification, one can record all
the Java details about the interface, such as the parameter mechanisms,
whether the method is `final', `protected', etc.; if one used a
specification language such as VDM-SL or Z, which is not tailored to
Java, then one could not record such details of the interface, which
could cause problems in code integration.  For example, in JML one can
specify the precise conditions under which certain exceptions may be
thrown, something which is difficult in a specification language that
is not tailored to Java and that doesn't have the notion of an
exception.

   When should JML documentation be written?  That is up to you, the
user.  A goal of JML is to make the notation indifferent to the precise
programming method used.  One can use JML either before coding or as
documentation of finished code.  While we recommend doing some design
before coding, JML can also be used for documentation after the code is
written.

   Reasons for formal documentation of interfaces and their behavior,
using JML, include the following.
   * One can ship the object code for a class library to customers,
     sending the JML specifications but not the source code.  Customers
     would then have documentation that is precise, unambiguous, but
     not overly specific.  Customers would not have the code,
     protecting proprietary rights.  In addition, customers would not
     rely on details of the implementation of the library that they
     might otherwise glean from the code, easing the process of
     improving the code in future releases.

   * One can use a formal specification to analyze certain properties of
     a design carefully or formally (see [Hall90] and Chapter 7 of
     [Guttag-Horning93]).  In general, the act of formally specifying a
     program module has salutary effects on the quality of the design.

   * One can use the JML specification as an aid to careful reasoning
     about the correctness of code, or even for formal verification
     [Huisman01] [Jacobs-Poll01] [Ruby06].

   * JML specifications can be used by several tools that can help debug
     and improve the code [Burdy-etal03].

   There is one additional benefit from using JML.  It is that JML
allows one to record not just public interfaces and behavior, but also
some detailed design decisions.  That is, in JML, one can specify not
just the public interface of a Java class, but also behavior of a
class's protected and private interfaces.  Formally documenting a base
class's protected interface and "subclassing contract" allows
programmers to implement derived classes of such a base class without
looking at its code [Ruby-Leavens00] [Ruby06].

   Recording the private interface of a class may be helpful in program
development or maintenance.  Usually one would expect that the public
interface of a class would be specified, and then separate, more
refined specifications would be given for use by derived classes and
for detailed implementation (and friend classes).  (*Note Refinement::,
for how to record each level in JML.)

   The reader may also wish to consult the "Preliminary Design of JML"
[Leavens-Baker-Ruby06] for a discussion of the goals that are behind
JML's design.  Apart from the improved precision in the specifications
and documentation of code, the main advantage of using a formal
specification language, as opposed to informal natural language, is the
possibility of tool support.  One specific goal that has emerged over
time is that JML should be able to unify several different
tool-building efforts in the area of formal methods.

   The most basic tool support for JML - simply parsing and
typechecking - is already useful.  Whereas informal comments in code
are typically not kept up to date as the code is changed, the simple
act of running the typechecker will catch any JML assertions referring
to parameter or field names that no longer exist, and all other typos
of course.  Enforcing the visibility rules can also provide useful
feedback; for example, a precondition of a `public' method which refers
to a `private' field of an object is suspect.

   Of course, there are more exciting forms of tool support than just
parsing and typechecking.  In particular JML is designed to support
static analysis (as in ESC/Java [Leino-etal00]), formal verification
(as in the LOOP tool [Huisman01] [Jacobs-etal98]), recording of
dynamically obtained invariants (as in Daikon [Ernst-etal01]), runtime
assertion checking (as in JML's runtime assertion checker, jmlc
[Cheon-Leavens02b] [Cheon03]), unit testing [Cheon-Leavens02], and
documentation (as in JML's jmldoc tool).  The paper by Burdy et al.
[Burdy-etal03] is a recent survey of tools for JML.  The utility of
these tools is the ultimate answer to the question of what JML is good
for.

1.4 Status and Plans for JML
============================

[[[This section needs updating.]]]JML is still in development.  As you
can see, this reference manual is still a draft, and there are some
holes in it.  [[[And some notes for the authors by the authors that
look like this.]]]

   Influences on JML that may lead to changes in its design include our
desire to specify programs written using the unique features of
MultiJava [Clifton-etal00], an eventual integration with Bandera
[Corbett-etal00] or other tools for specification of concurrency,
aspect-oriented programming, and the evolution of Java itself.  Another
influence is the ongoing effort to use JML on examples, in designing
the JML tools, and efforts to give a formal semantics to JML.

1.5 Historical Precedents
=========================

JML combines ideas from Eiffel [Meyer92a] [Meyer92b] [Meyer97] with
ideas from model-based specification languages such as VDM [Jones90]
and the Larch family [Guttag-Horning93] [LeavensLarchFAQ] [Wing87]
[Wing90a].  It also adds some ideas from the refinement calculus
[Back88] [Back-vonWright89a] [Back-vonWright98] [Morgan-Vickers94]
[Morgan94] (*note Refinement::).  In this section we describe the
advantages and disadvantages of these approaches.  Readers unfamiliar
with these historical precedents may want to skip this section.

   Formal, model-based languages such as those typified by the Larch
family build on ideas found originally in Hoare's work.  Hoare used
pre- and postconditions to describe the semantics of computer programs
in his famous article [Hoare69].  Later Hoare adapted these axiomatic
techniques to the specification and correctness proofs of abstract data
types [Hoare72a].  To specify an ADT, Hoare described a mathematical
set of abstract values for the type, and then specified pre- and
postconditions for each of the operations of the type in terms of how
the abstract values of objects were affected.  For example, one might
specify a class `IntHeap' using abstract values of the form `empty' and
`add(i,h)', where `i' is an `int' and `h' is an `IntHeap'.  These
notations form a mathematical vocabulary used in the rest of the
specification.

   There are two advantages to writing specifications with abstract
values instead of directly using Java variables and data structures.
The first is that by using abstract values, the specification does not
have to be changed when the particular data structure used in the
program is changed.  This permits different implementations of the same
specification to use different data structures.  Therefore the
specification forms a contract between the rest of the program in the
implementation, which ensures that the rest of the program is also
independent of the particular data structures used [Liskov-Guttag86]
[Meyer97] [Meyer92a] [Parnas72].  Second, it allows the specification
to be written even when there are no implementation data structures, as
is the case for `IntHeap'.

   This idea of model-oriented specification has been followed in VDM
[Jones90], VDM-SL [Fitzgerald-Larsen98] [ISO96], Z [Hayes93] [Spivey92],
and the Larch family [Guttag-Horning93].  In the Larch approach, the
essential elaboration of Hoare's original idea is that the abstract
values also come with a set of operations.  The operations on abstract
values are used to precisely describe the set of abstract values and to
make it possible to abbreviate interface specifications (pre- and
postconditions for methods).  In Z one builds abstract values using
tuples, sets, relations, functions, sequences, and bags; these all come
with pre-defined operations that can be used in assertions.  In VDM one
has a similar collection of mathematical tools to describe abstract
values, and another set of pre-defined operations.  In the Larch
approach, there are some pre-defined kinds of abstract values (found in
Guttag and Horning's LSL Handbook, Appendix A of [Guttag-Horning93]),
but these are expected to be extended as needed.  (The advantage of
being able to extend the mathematical vocabulary is similar to one
advantage of object-oriented programming: one can use a vocabulary that
is close to the way one thinks about a problem.)

   However, there is a problem with using mathematical notations for
describing abstract values and their operations.  The problem is that
such mathematical notations are an extra burden on a programmer who is
learning to use a specification language.  The solution to this problem
is the essential insight that JML takes from the Eiffel language
[Meyer92a] [Meyer92b] [Meyer97].  Eiffel is a programming language with
built-in specification constructs.  It features pre- and
postconditions, although it has no direct support for frame axioms.
Programmers like Eiffel because they can easily read the assertions,
which are written in Eiffel's own expression syntax.  However, Eiffel
does not provide support for specification-only variables, and it does
not provide much explicit support for describing abstract values.
Because of this, it is difficult to write specifications that are as
mathematically complete in Eiffel as one can write in a language like
VDM or Larch/C++.

   JML attempts to combine the good features of these approaches.  From
Eiffel we have taken the idea that assertions can be written in a
language that is based on Java expressions.  We also adopt the "`old'"
notation from Eiffel, which appears in JML as `\old', instead of the
Larch-style annotation of names with state functions.  To make it easy
to write more complete specifications, however, we use various semantic
ideas from model-based specification languages.  In particular we use a
variant of abstract value specifications, where one describes the
abstract value of an object implicitly using several model fields.
These specification-only fields allow one to implicitly partition the
abstract value of an object into smaller chunks, which helps in stating
frame axioms.  More importantly, we hide the mathematical notation
behind a facade of Java classes.  This makes it so the operations on
abstract values appear in familiar (although perhaps verbose) Java
notation, and also insulates JML from the details of the particular
mathematical logic used to do reasoning.

2.1 Types can be Classes and Interfaces
=======================================

In this manual we use "type" to mean either a class, interface, or
primitive value type in Java.  (Primitive value types include
`boolean', `int', etc.)

   A "reference type" is a type that is not a primitive value type,
that is either a class or interface.  When it is not necessary to
emphasize that primitive value types are not included, we often shorten
"reference type" to just "type".


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Model and Ghost,  Next: Lightweight and Heavyweight Specifications,  Prev: Types can be Classes and Interfaces,  Up: Fundamental Concepts

2.2 Model and Ghost
===================

In JML one can declare various names with the modifier `model'; for
example one can declare model fields, methods, and even types.  One can
also declare some fields as `ghost' fields.  JML also has a `model
import' directive (*note Compilation Units::).

   The meaning of a feature declared with `model' is that it is only
present for specification purposes.  For example a model field is an
imaginary field that is only used for specifications and is not
available for use in Java code outside of annotations.  Similarly, a
model method is a method that can be used in annotations, but cannot be
used in ordinary Java code.  A model import directive imports names
that can be used only within annotations.

   The most common and useful model declarations are model fields.  A
model field should be thought of as the abstraction of one or more
non-model (i.e., Java or "concrete") fields [Cheon-etal05].  (By
contrast, some authors refer to what JML calls model fields as
"abstract fields" [Leino98].)  The value of a model field is determined
by the concrete fields it abstracts from; in JML this relationship is
specified by a `represents' clause (*note Represents Clauses::).  (Thus
the values of the model fields in an object determines its "abstract
value" [Hoare72a].)  A model field also defines a data group [Leino98],
which collects model and concrete fields and is used to tell JML what
concrete fields may be assigned by various methods (*note Data
Groups::).

   Unlike model fields, model methods and model types are not
abstractions of non-model methods or types.  They are simply methods or
types that we imagine that the program has, to help in a specification.

   A `ghost' field is similar to a model field, in that it is also only
present for purposes of specification and thus cannot be used outside
of annotations.  However, unlike a model field, a ghost field does not
have a value determined by a represents clause; instead its value is
directly determined by its initialization or by a SET-STATEMENT (*note
Statements and Annotation Statements::).

   Although these model and ghost names are used only for
specifications, JML uses the same namespace for such names as for
normal Java names.  Thus, one cannot declare a field to be both a model
(or ghost) field and a normal Java field in the same class (or in a
refinement, *note Refinement::).  Similarly, a method is either a model
method or not.  In part, this is done because JML has no syntactic
distinction between Java and JML field access or method calls.  This
decision makes it an error for someone to use the same name as a model
or ghost feature in an implementation.  In such a case if the Java code
is considered to be the goal, one can either change the name of the JML
feature or have one declaration in which the Java feature is modified
with the JML modifier `spec_public'.  *Note Privacy Modifiers and
Visibility::, for more about `spec_public'.

2.3 Lightweight and Heavyweight Specifications
==============================================

In JML one is not required to specify behavior completely.  Indeed, JML
has a style of method specification case, called "lightweight", in
which the user only says what interests them.  On the other hand, in a
"heavyweight" specification case, JML expects that the user is fully
aware of the defaults involved. In a heavyweight specification case,
JML expects that a user only omits parts of the specification case when
the user believes that the default is appropriate.

   Users distinguish these between such cases of method specifications
by using different syntaxes. *Note Organization of Method
Specifications::, for details, but in essence in a method specification
case that uses one of the behavior keywords (such as `normal_behavior',
`exceptional_behavior', or `behavior') is heavyweight, while one that
does not use such a keyword is lightweight.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Privacy Modifiers and Visibility,  Next: Instance vs. Static,  Prev: Lightweight and Heavyweight Specifications,  Up: Fundamental Concepts

2.4 Privacy Modifiers and Visibility
====================================

Java code that is not within an annotation uses the usual access control
rules for determining visibility (or accessibility) of Java
[Arnold-Gosling-Holmes00] [Gosling-etal00].  That is, a name declared
in package P and type P.T may be referenced from outside P only if it
is declared as `public', or if it is declared as `protected' and the
reference occurs within a subclass of P.T.  This name may be referenced
from within P but outside of P.T only if it is declared as `public',
default access, or `protected'.  Such a name may always be referenced
from within P.T, even if it is declared as `private'.  See the Java
language specification [Gosling-etal00] for details on visibility rules
applied to nested and inner classes.

   Within annotations, JML imposes some extra rules in addition to the
usual Java visibility rules [Leavens-Baker-Ruby06].  These rules depend
not just on the declaration of the name but also on the visibility
level of the context that is referring to the name in question.  For
purposes of this section, the "annotation context" of a reference to a
name is the smallest grammatical unit with an attached (or implicit)
visibility.  For example, this annotation context can be a method
specification case, an invariant, a history constraint, or a field
declaration.  The visibility level of such an annotation context can be
`public', `protected', `private', or default (package) visibility.

   The JML rule, in essence, is that an annotation context cannot refer
to names that are more hidden than the context's own visibility.  That
is, for a reference to a name x to be legal, the visibility of the
annotation context that contains the reference to x must be at least as
permissive as the declaration of x itself.  The reason for this
restriction is that the people who are allowed to see the annotation
should be able to see each of the names used in that annotation
[Meyer97], otherwise they might not understand it.  For example, public
clients should be able to see all the declarations of names in publicly
visible annotations, hence public annotations should not contain
protected, default access, or private names.

   In more detail, suppose x is a name declared in package P and type
P.T.
   * An expression in a public annotation context (e.g., in  a public
     method specification) can refer to x only if x is declared as
     `public'.

   * An expression in a protected annotation context (e.g., in a
     protected method specification) can refer to x only if x is
     declared as `public' or `protected', and x must also be visible
     according to Java's rules (so if x is `protected', then the
     reference must either be from within P or, if it is from outside P,
     then the reference must occur in a subclass of P.T).

   * An expression in a default (package) visibility annotation context
     (e.g., in a default visibility method specification) can refer to
     x only if x is declared as `public', `protected', or with default
     visibility, and x must also be visible according to Java's rules
     (so if x has default visibility, then the reference must be from
     within P).

   * An expression in a `private' visibility annotation context (e.g.,
     in a private method specification) can refer to x only if x is
     visible according to Java's rules (so if x has private visibility,
     then the reference must be from within P.T).

   In the following example, the comments on the right show which uses
of the various privacy level names are legal and illegal.  Similar
examples could be given for method specifications, history constraints,
and so on.

     public class PrivacyDemoLegalAndIllegal {
        public int pub;
        protected int prot;
        int def;
        private int priv;

        //@ public invariant pub > 0;      // legal
        //@ public invariant prot > 0;     // illegal!
        //@ public invariant def > 0;      // illegal!
        //@ public invariant priv < 0;     // illegal!

        //@ protected invariant pub > 1;   // legal
        //@ protected invariant prot > 1;  // legal
        //@ protected invariant def > 1;   // illegal!
        //@ protected invariant priv < 1;  // illegal!

        //@ invariant pub > 1;              // legal
        //@ invariant prot > 1;             // legal
        //@ invariant def > 1;              // legal
        //@ invariant priv < 1;             // illegal!

        //@ private invariant pub > 1;      // legal
        //@ private invariant prot > 1;     // legal
        //@ private invariant def > 1;      // legal
        //@ private invariant priv < 1;     // legal
     }

   Note that in a lightweight method specification, the privacy level
is assumed to be the same privacy level as the method itself.  That is,
for example, a protected method with a lightweight method specification
is considered to be a protected annotation context for purposes of
checking proper visibility usage [Leavens-Baker-Ruby06] [Mueller02].
*Note Lightweight and Heavyweight Specifications::, for more about the
differences between lightweight and heavyweight specification cases.

   The ESC/Java2 system has the same visibility rules as described
above.  (However, this was not true of the old version of ESC/Java
[Leino-Nelson-Saxe00].)

   The JML keywords `spec_public' and `spec_protected' provide a way to
make a declaration that has different visibilities for Java and JML.
For example, the following declaration declares an integer field that
Java regards as private but JML regards as public.

         private /*@ spec_public @*/ int length;

Thus for example, `length' in the above declaration could be used in a
public method specification or invariant.

   However, `spec_public' is more than just a way to change the
visibility of a name for specification purposes.  When applied to
fields it can be considered to be shorthand for the declaration of a
model field with the same name.  That is, the declaration of `length'
above can be thought of as equivalent to the following declarations,
together with a rewrite of the Java code that uses `length' to use
`_length' instead (where we assume `_length' is fresh, i.e., not used
elsewhere).

       //@ public model int length;
       private int _length; //@ in length;
       //@ private represents length <- _length;

   The above desugaring allows one to change the underlying field
without affecting the readers of the specification.

   The desugaring of `spec_protected' is the same as for `spec_public',
except that one uses `protected' instead of `public' in the desugared
form.

2.5 Instance vs. Static
=======================

In Java, a feature of a class or interface may declared to be `static'.
This means that the feature is not part of instances of that type, and
it means that references to that feature (from outside the type and its
subtypes) must use a qualified name of the form T.f, which refers to
the static feature f in type T.

   A feature, such as a field or method, of a type that is not static is
an "instance" feature.  For example, in a Java interface, all the
methods declared are instance methods, although fields are static by
default.  In a Java class the default is that all features are instance
features, unless the modifier `static' is used.

   In JML declarations follow the normal Java rules for determining
whether they are instance or static features of a type.  However,
within annotations it is possible to explicitly label features as
`instance' (*note Type Definitions:: for the syntax).  The use of the
`instance' modifier is necessary to declare model and ghost instance
fields in interfaces, since otherwise the Java default modifier for
fields in interfaces (static) would apply.

   It is also useful, in JML, to label invariants as either static or
instance invariants. *Note Static vs. instance invariants::, for more
on this topic.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Locations and Aliasing,  Next: Expression Evaluation and Undefinedness,  Prev: Instance vs. Static,  Up: Fundamental Concepts

2.6 Locations and Aliasing
==========================

A "location" is a field of an object or a local variable.  A "local
variable" is either a variable declared inside a method or a formal
parameter of a method.

   An "access path" is an expression either of the form x, where x is
an identifier, or p`.'x, where p is an access path and x is an
identifier.(1) (In forming an access path, we ignore visibility.)

   In a given program state, s, a location l is "aliased" if there are
two or more access paths that, in s, both denote l.  The access paths
in question are said to be "aliases" for l.  Similarly, we say that an
object o is aliased in a state s if there are two access paths that, in
s, both have o as their value.  In Java, it is impossible to alias
local variables, so the only aliasing possible involves objects and
their fields.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) By an identifier, we technically mean an IDENT in the Java
grammar. *Note Tokens::, for details.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Expression Evaluation and Undefinedness,  Next: Null is Not the Default,  Prev: Locations and Aliasing,  Up: Fundamental Concepts

2.7 Expression Evaluation and Undefinedness
===========================================

Within JML annotations, Java expressions have the values that are
defined in the Java Language Specification [Gosling-etal00].  This has
consequences on the interpretation of assertion expressions [Chalin07]
[Rioux-Chalin07]: an assertion is taken to be valid if and only if its
interpretation
   * does not cause an exception to be raised, and

   * yields the value true.
   Note that this interpretation of assertions, said to be based on
"strong validity" [Chalin07], was made the default assertion semantics
for JML in 2007.  Prior to that, assertions were interpreted using a
classical defintion of validity [Leavens-etal05] [Leavens-Baker-Ruby06]
[Gries-Schneider95] [Jones95e].

   The strong validity semantics for assertion evaluation means that
exceptions may arise during evaluation of subexpressions within
assertions.  These exceptions should be avoided by the specifier and
tools are encouraged to warn users when they detect that an exception
may arise during assertion evalution.

   To avoid exceptions during assertion evaluation, specifiers should
practice good Java coding habits, and write specifications that prevent
such exceptions.  To do this, one can use left-to-right ordering of
evaluation of subexpressions and the short-curcuit nature of the Java
operators `&&' and `||'.  JML also evaluates the its two implication
operators, `==>' and `<==' in short-curcuit fashion.  Within a
specification case, the precondition can protect the rest of the
specification from exceptions [Leavens-Wing98].  That is, one can
assume that the precondition holds in the remainder of the clauses in a
specification case.  JML also evaluates multiple occurrences of clauses
of the same kind (such as `requires' or `ensures') within a spec case
in top to bottom order, so earlier clauses can protect later ones, just
as if they were combined with `&&'.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Null is Not the Default,  Next: Language Levels,  Prev: Expression Evaluation and Undefinedness,  Up: Fundamental Concepts

2.8 Null is Not the Default
===========================

One common problem that occurs in Java and JML specifications is the
possibility of `null' dereferences.  For example, if `x' is `null' then
`x.f' and `x.m()' both result in a `NullPointerException'.  Such null
pointer exceptions cause undefinedness in expression evaluation, as
described above (*note Expression Evaluation and Undefinedness::).

   To avoid having to constantly specify that declarations (other than
local variables) are non-null, JML makes them implicitly `non_null' by
default.  That is, unless a
   * member field (*note Field and Variable Declarations::),

   * formal parameter, (*note Formal Parameters::),

   * method return type (*note Method and Constructor Declarations::),
     or

   * bound variable (*note Modifiers for Bound Variables::)
   is explicitly annotated with the modifier `nullable', that
declaration is assumed to be `non_null'.

   For a field whose type is an array of reference types, such as a
field of type `Object[]', both the field that refers to the array and
the elements of the array are `non_null' by default.  If a field whose
type is an array of reference types is declared as `nullable', then
both the reference to the array and all of its elements may potentially
be null.  To specify that the field is not null but the elements may be
null, use an invariant to state that the field cannot contain null, as
follows.

     private /*@ spec_public nullable @*/ Object[] a;
     //@ public invariant a != null;

   While these defaults differ from Java, research has found that in
most cases a declaration is expected to be non-null [Chalin-Rioux05].
More importantly, since one of the most common mistakes in JML
specifications (and in Java programs) is forgetting to specify that a
declaration is non-null, making the default be that they cannot hold
null helps eliminate a source of common errors in specifications.

2.9 Language Levels
===================

One of JML's goals is to provide a single language that can be used
with a variety of different tools.  However, JML is also an evolving
language that is used as a research vehicle by many groups.  The
evolution of JML means that some features are not completely documented
or implemented.  Use of JML in research means that some tools will have
features that are not supported by other tools.  All of this has the
potential to threaten portability and to make JML more difficult to
learn and use.

   The research groups working on JML are committed to making these
problems as invisible to non-researchers as possible, and for this
reason have defined several "language levels".  The goal of defining
these language levels is to make it easier to learn and use JML and its
various tools.

   We define the following language levels.(1)
   * Level 0 should be supported by all JML tools and constitutes the
     heart of JML.  All users should be familiar with these level 0
     features.  They are fundamental to all uses of JML, including its
     use as a design by contract language, as documentation, and as
     formal specification for formal verification efforts.  Thus the
     level 0 features should be the ones that tutorial materials
     concentrate on.  Users should be able to count on these features
     being understood and checked by all tools.

   * Level 1 should be supported by most JML tools and should be a first
     priority for developers after implementing the Level 0 features.
     There are three categories of features that level 1 adds to level
     0.  The first is the redundancy features of JML, which are useful
     in documentation, but not absolutely vital.  The second is
     features that are sugars for features present in level 0.  The
     third is various features for which modular static verification is
     still problematic, although a runtime assertion checking semantics
     has been implemented.  This includes the use of methods and
     constructor calls in assertions.

   * Level 2 contains features that are more specialized to particular
     uses of JML, but are still useful for several different tools.  It
     also contains some features that are mainly needed to explain
     JML's semantics, and have not been heavily used (so far).

   * Level 3 features are even less commonly used and more exotic
     features.  The semantics of some of these features are not yet
     well understood, and the features are not implemented by many
     tools.

   * Level C contains features related to specification and
     verification of concurrent Java programs.  Some of these are from
     ESC/Java [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00], and others are from
     [Rodriguez-etal05].

   * Level X contains experimental features, which may eventually be
     moved to other levels.  Many tools will have other experimental
     features not documented here.


   When learning JML, one should focus on levels 0 features first, as
these form the heart of the language which should be understood by all
JML tools.  Features at level 1 are next in importance and should be
supported by most tools that are interested in having a large user
base.  Features at higher levels are less important and may not be
present in all tools.  Users should feel free to ignore them unless
they meet some specific need.

   The language levels also provide guidance for tool designers.  JML
tools should parse all of the syntax in this reference manual that is
not marked as experimental.  This is the most important way to
guarantee portability for users, and the easiest way for tools to get
feedback.   In addition, tools should check at least level 0, and
preferably level 1 features.  Features at levels 2 and 3 are candidates
for the tool to just parse and ignore, if they are not features of
interest for that tool.  Experimental features may ignored (or added)
by any tool.

   Many tool developers may want to start off supporting only a subset
of JML defined by level 0 and then move on to higher levels.

   It is also suggested that tools give users optional feedback, perhaps
in a verbose mode, as to which features are fully and partially
supported.  Clearly stating which JML levels are supported in a tool
release is also very important.

   More details are provided in the subsections below.

2.9.1 Level 0 Features
----------------------

The features in this level form the core of JML and should be
understood and checked by all JML tools.  Beginning users should pay
the most attention to these features.  These features include all of
Java and the syntax described in the rest of this section.

   Many, but not all, of the JML additions to Java's MODIFIERs (*note
Modifiers::) are level 0 features. The following modifiers are included
in level 0.

   * The MODIFIER `spec_public' (*note Spec Public::).

   * The MODIFIER `spec_protected' (*note Spec Protected::).

   * The MODIFIER `instance' (*note Instance::).

   * The MODIFIER `model' (*note Model::), as applied to field
     declarations (*note JML Modifiers for Fields::).  Note that this
     modifier as applied to other declarations is not a level 0 feature.

   * The MODIFIER `ghost' (*note Ghost::), as applied to both field and
     variable declarations (*note Field and Variable Declarations::).

   * The MODIFIER `helper' (*note Helper::).

   Type specifications (*note Type Specifications::) are a level 0
feature, although not all clauses and features of type specifications
are level 0.  The following type-level clauses are included in level 0.

   * Object invariants, that is an INVARIANT (*note Invariants::) that
     is either written in an interface using the MODIFIER `instance'
     (*note Instance::) or one that is written in a class and that does
     not use the MODIFIER `static' (*note Static vs. instance
     invariants::).

   * The functional form of a REPRESENTS-CLAUSE (*note Represents
     Clauses::).  That is, a represents clause that uses L-ARROW-OR-EQ
     and (not `\such_that').

   * The INITIALLY-CLAUSE (*note Initially Clauses::).

   * The TYPE-SPEC `\TYPE' (optionally, as a type of array element).
     *Note Type-Specs::, for more details.

   Method specifications (*note Method Specifications::) are a level 0
feature.  This includes the ability to combine specification cases using
`also' (*note Semantics of nested behavior specification cases::) and
specification inheritance [Dhara-Leavens96] [Leavens-Naumann06]
[Leavens06b].  It also includes the use of `\not_specified' for all
specification clauses that are at level 0.  However, not all clauses
and features of method specifications are level 0. The following parts
of method specifications are included in level 0.  Redundancy features
of method specifications are only present at level 1, not at level 0.
The details are described below.

   * Lightweight specification cases (*note Lightweight Specification
     Cases::), although not all clauses that are allowed in the syntax
     are in level 0.

   * Heavyweight specification cases (*note Heavyweight Specification
     Cases::) that do not use the keyword `code'.  This includes
     BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASE (*note Behavior Specification Cases::),
     NORMAL-BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASE (*note Normal Behavior Specification
     Cases::), and EXCEPTIONAL-BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASE (*note Exceptional
     Behavior Specification Cases::).  However, note that not all
     clauses that are allowed in the syntax are in level 0.

   * The REQUIRES-CLAUSE (*note Requires Clauses::).  The redundant
     form of this clause (`requires_redundantly', `pre_redundantly') is
     a level 1 feature.

   * The ENSURES-CLAUSE (*note Ensures Clauses::).  The redundant form
     of this clause (`ensures_redundantly', `post_redundantly') is a
     level 1 feature.

   * The SIGNALS-CLAUSE (*note Signals Clauses::).  The redundant form
     of this clause (`signals_redundantly', `exsures_redundantly') is a
     level 1 feature.

   * The SIGNALS_ONLY-CLAUSE (*note Signals-Only Clauses::).  The
     redundant form of this clause (`signals_only_redundantly') is a
     level 1 feature.

   * The ASSIGNABLE-CLAUSE (*note Assignable Clauses::).  The redundant
     form of this clause (`assignable_redundantly',
     `modifiable_redundantly', `modifies_redundantly') is a level 1
     feature.

   Only static data groups (*note Data Groups::) are part of level 0.

   * The IN-GROUP-CLAUSE (*note Static Data Group Inclusions::) kind of
     JML-DATA-GROUP-CLAUSE that attaches to field declarations (*note
     Field and Variable Declarations::).

   Some of JML's extensions to Java's EXPRESSION syntax (*note
Predicates and Specification Expressions::), but not all of them, can
be used at level 0.  Note that calls to pure methods and constructors
in SPEC-EXPRESSIONs are _not_ part of level 0, but are only found at
level 1.  We describe the level 0 specification expressions below.

   * The RESULT-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash result::).

   * The OLD-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash old and Backslash pre::).

   * The FRESH-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash fresh::).

   * The NONNULLELEMENTS-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash nonnullelements::).

   * The INFORMAL-DESCRIPTION (*note Informal Predicates::).

   * The TYPEOF-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash typeof::).

   * The ELEMTYPE-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash elemtype::).

   * The TYPE-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash type::).

   * The SPEC-QUANTIFIED-EXPR (*note Quantified Expressions::) forms
     that use the QUANTIFIER keywords `\forall' and `\exists' (*note
     Universal and Existential Quantifiers::).

     (The QUANTIFIER keywords `\max', `\min', `\product', and `\sum'
     (*note Generalized Quantifiers::), as well as `\num_of' (*note
     Numerical Quantifier::, are all level 1 features.)

   * The `<:' operator (*note Subtype operator::).

   * The `<==>' and `<=!=>' operators (*note Equivalence and
     Inequivalence Operators::).

   * The `==>' and `<==' operators (*note Forward and Reverse
     Implication Operators::).

   * The syntax for STORE-REFs (*note Store Refs::).

   All of the Java statements and most of the JML extensions for adding
assertions to statements and annotation statements (*note Statements
and Annotation Statements::) are at level 0.  But redundancy features
of the JML extensions are only present at level 1, not at level 0.  We
describe the level 0 extension to statements below.

   * Using the MODIFIER `ghost' in LOCAL-DECLARATIONs (*note Modifiers
     for Local Declarations::).

   * The POSSIBLY-ANNOTATED-LOOP statement (*note Loop Statements::),
     with a LOOP-INVARIANT (*note Loop Invariants::).  The redundant
     forms of LOOP-INVARIANTs, namely those that use the keywords
     `maintaining_redundantly' and `loop_invariant_redundantly' are
     level 1 features.  Furthermore, the VARIANT-FUNCTION is a level 1
     feature.

   * The ASSERT-STATEMENT (*note Assert Statements::).  Note that the
     ASSERT-REDUNDANTLY-STATEMENT, which uses the keyword
     `assert_redundantly', is in level 1.

   * The non-redundant form of the ASSUME-STATEMENT (*note Assume
     Statements::).  Use of the keyword `assume_redundantly' is a level
     1 feature.

   * The SET-STATEMENT (*note Set Statements::).

   The ability to use a `.spec' file (*note File Name Suffixes::) to
give a separate specification for a compilation unit that only appears
in binary form (e.g., in a `.class' file) is a level 0 feature.  Use of
the REFINE-PREFIX (*note Refinement::) is a level 1 feature.

   Some syntax from the Universe type system (*note Universe Type
System::) is included in level 0.  However, `readonly' is considered to
be in level X, as is the semantics of the Universe type system.  The
`rep' and `peer' modifiers are included in level 0 because, in some
form, they are important to the semantics of several level 0 features
[Mueller-Poetzsch-Heffter-Leavens03]
[Mueller-Poetzsch-Heffter-Leavens06].

   * The `\rep' and `rep' OWNERSHIP-MODIFIERs (*note Rep and Peer::).

   * The `\peer' and `peer' OWNERSHIP-MODIFIERs (*note Rep and Peer::).

2.9.2 Level 1 Features
----------------------

The features in this level will be understood and checked by many JML
tools.  They are quite important in practice, especially the use of
methods and constructors in writing the specifications of other methods
and constructors.  Also useful are all of JML's redundancy features
(*note Redundancy::), which are included here for level 0 features and
for other features at level 1.

   The following additions to Java's MODIFIERs (*note Modifiers::) are
level 1 features.

   * Method or constructor declarations that use the MODIFIER `model'
     (*note Model Methods and Constructors::).  However, note that
     using `model' on a field declarations is a level 0 feature and
     that using `model' on a type declaration is a level 2 feature.

   * IMPORT-DEFINITIONs that use the modifier `model' (*note Import
     Definitions::).

   * The MODIFIER `pure' (*note Pure::).

   * The MODIFIER `uninitialized' (*note Uninitialized::).

   The following type-level clauses (*note Type Specifications::) are
included in level 1.

   * Attaching a METHOD-SPECIFICATION to a CLASS-INITIALIZER-DECL
     (*note Class Initializer Declarations::).

   * Static invariants, that is an INVARIANT (*note Invariants::) that
     is either written in an interface without using the MODIFIER
     `instance' (*note Instance::), or one that is written in a class
     and that uses the MODIFIER `static' (*note Static vs. instance
     invariants::).

   * Both object and static HISTORY-CONSTRAINTs (*note Constraints::).

   * The AXIOM-CLAUSE (*note Axioms::).

   * The MAPS-INTO-CLAUSE (*note Dynamic Data Group Mappings::) kind of
     JML-DATA-GROUP-CLAUSE that attaches to field declarations (*note
     Field and Variable Declarations::).

   The following features of method specifications (*note Method
Specifications::) are included in level 1.

   * The SPEC-VAR-DECLS that may occur in a specification case (*note
     Specification Variable Declarations::).

   * The REDUNDANT-SPEC parts of a method specification (*note
     Redundancy::) are also included in level 1.  The following
     describes these parts.

        * The IMPLICATIONS (`implies_that') part of a REDUNDANT-SPEC
          (*note Redundant Implications and Redundantly Clauses::).

        * The EXAMPLES (`for_example') part of a REDUNDANT-SPEC.

   The following extensions to Java's EXPRESSION syntax (*note
Predicates and Specification Expressions::) are included in level 1.

   * The SPEC-QUANTIFIED-EXPR (*note Quantified Expressions::) forms
     that use the QUANTIFIER keywords `\max', `\min', `\product', and
     `\sum' (*note Generalized Quantifiers::), as well as `\num_of'
     (*note Numerical Quantifier::).

     (Note that the `\max' quantifier is distinct from the
     MAX-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash max::), which is a level C feature.
     Also, note that the QUANTIFIER keywords `\forall' and `\exists'
     are level 0 features.)

   * Calls to pure methods and constructors (*note Pure Methods and
     Constructors::) in SPEC-EXPRESSIONs (*note Predicates and
     Specification Expressions::).

   * The SET-COMPREHENSION expression (*note Set Comprehensions::).

   The following additions to Java's statement syntax (*note Statements
and Annotation Statements::) are included in level 1.

   * The use of redundant forms of LOOP-INVARIANTs (*note Loop
     Invariants::) namely those that use the keywords
     `maintaining_redundantly' and `loop_invariant_redundantly'.
     Non-redundant LOOP-INVARIANTs are in level 0.

   * The POSSIBLY-ANNOTATED-LOOP statement (*note Loop Statements::),
     with a VARIANT-FUNCTION (*note Loop Variant Functions::).

   * The ASSERT-REDUNDANTLY-STATEMENT (*note Assert Statements::); that
     is, assert statements that use the keyword `assert_redundantly'.
     The non-redundant ASSERT-STATEMENTs are a level 0 feature.

   * The redundant form of the ASSUME-STATEMENT (*note Assume
     Statements::); that is, assume statements that use the keyword
     `assume_redundantly'.  The non-redundant ASSUME-STATEMENTs are a
     level 0 feature.

   The REFINE-PREFIX (*note Refinement::).  However, the ability to use
a `.spec' file to give a separate specification for a compilation unit
that only appears in binary form (e.g., in a `.class' file) is a level
0 feature.

   The `\bigint' type (*note Backslash bigint::) from the safe math
extensions (*note Safe Math Extensions::) is a level 1 feature.

2.9.3 Level 2 Features
----------------------

Level 2 contains features that are more specialized to particular uses
of JML, but are still useful for several different tools.  It also
contains some features that are mainly needed to explain JML's
semantics, and have not been heavily used (so far).

   The NOWARN-PRAGMA (*note Lexical Pragmas::).

   The following type-level clauses (*note Type Specifications::) are
included in level 2.

   * The relational form of a REPRESENTS-CLAUSE (*note Represents
     Clauses::).  That is, a represents clause that uses `\such_that'.
     Note that the functional form of such represents clauses is a
     level 0 feature.

   * The READABLE-IF-CLAUSE clause (*note Readable If Clauses::).

   * The WRITABLE-IF-CLAUSE clause (*note Writable If Clauses::).

     Programs::).

   * The REFINING-STATEMENT (*note Refining Statements::).

   * The `extract' modifier (*note Extracting Model Program
     Specifications::).

   The following extensions to Java's EXPRESSION syntax (*note

   * The REACH-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash reach::).

   * The IS-INITIALIZED-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash is_initialized::).

   * The INVARIANT-FOR-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash invariant_for::).

   * The LBLNEG-EXPRESSION and the LBLPOS-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash
     lblneg and lblpos::).

   The following additions to Java's statement syntax (*note Statements
and Annotation Statements::) are included in level 2.

   * The UNREACHABLE-STATEMENT (*note Unreachable Statements::).

   * The DEBUG-STATEMENT (*note Debug Statements::)

   * The HENCE-BY-STATEMENT (*note Hence By Statements::).

   Note that all the MODEL-PROG-STATEMENTs (*note Model Programs::) are
at level 2, because the model program style of method specification is
at this level.

   Aside from the `\bigint' type (*note Backslash bigint::), which is a
level 1 feature, the rest of the safe math extensions (*note Safe Math
Extensions::) are level 2 features.  This includes the following
particulars.

   * The `\real' type (*note Backslash real::).

   * The MODIFIERs  `code_bigint_math', `code_java_math',
     `code_safe_math', `spec_bigint_math', `spec_java_math', and
     `spec_safe_math' (*note Math Modifiers::).

   * The WHEN-CLAUSE (*note When Clauses::).

   * The LOCKSET-EXPRESSION (*note Backslash lockset::).

2.9.6 Level X Features
----------------------

The features in this level are experimental.  They are as follows.

   * The MultiJava extensions to JML (*note MultiJava Extensions to

     (*note Augmenting Method Declarations::) and
     MULTIJAVA-PARAM-DECLARATION (*note MultiMethods::).

   * The `\readonly' and `readonly' OWNERSHIP-MODIFIERs from the

3 Syntax Notation
*****************

We use an extended Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar to describe the
syntax of JML.  The extensions are as follows [Ledgard80].

   * Nonterminal symbols are written as follows: NONTERMINAL.  That is,
     nonterminal symbols appear in UPPER-CASE.

   * Terminal symbols are written as follows: `terminal'.

   * Square brackets ([ and ]) surround optional text. Note that `['
     and `]' are terminals.

   * The notation ... means that the preceding nonterminal or group of
     optional text can be repeated zero (0) or more times.

   For example, the following gives a production for a non-empty list of
INIT-DECLARATORs, separated by commas.

     INIT-DECLARATOR-LIST ::= INIT-DECLARATOR [ `,' INIT-DECLARATOR ] ...

   To remind the reader that the notation `...' means zero or more
repetitions, we try to use `...' only following optional text,
although, in cases such as the following, the brackets could have been
omitted.

     MODIFIERS ::= [ MODIFIER ] ...

   As in the above examples, we follow the C++ standard's conventions
[ANSI95] in using nonterminal names of the form X-LIST to mean a
comma-separated list, and nonterminal names of the form X-SEQ to mean a
sequence not separated by commas.  An example of a sequence is the
following

     SPEC-CASE-SEQ ::= SPEC-CASE [ `also' SPEC-CASE ] ...

   We use "//" to start a comment (to you, the reader) in the grammar.

   A complete summary of the JML grammar appears in an appendix (*note
Grammar Summary::).  When reading the HTML version of this appendix,
one can click on the names of nonterminals to bring that nonterminal's
definition to the top of the browser's window.  This is helpful when
dealing with such a large grammar.

   Another help in dealing with the grammar is to use the index (*note
Concept Index::).  Every nonterminal and terminal symbol in the grammar
is found in the index, and each definition and use is noted.  [[[Or
rather, it will be...]]]

4 Lexical Conventions
*********************

This chapter presents the lexical conventions of JML, that is, the
microsyntax of JML.

   Throughout this chapter, grammatical productions are to be
understood lexically.  That is, no WHITE-SPACE (*note White Space::)
may intervene between the characters of a token.  (However, outside
this chapter, the opposite of this convention is in force.)

   The microsyntax of JML is described by the production MICROSYNTAX
below; it describes what a program looks like from the point of view of
a lexical analyzer [Watt91].

     MICROSYNTAX ::= LEXEME [ LEXEME ] ...
     LEXEME ::= WHITE-SPACE | LEXICAL-PRAGMA | COMMENT
             | ANNOTATION-MARKER | DOC-COMMENT | TOKEN
     TOKEN ::= IDENT | KEYWORD | SPECIAL-SYMBOL
             | JAVA-LITERAL | INFORMAL-DESCRIPTION

   In the rest of this section we provide more details on each of the
major nonterminals used in the above grammar.

4.1 White Space
===============

Blanks, horizontal and vertical tabs, carriage returns, formfeeds, and
newlines, collectively called "white space", are ignored except as they
serve to separate tokens.  Newlines and carriage returns are special in
that they cannot appear in some contexts where other whitespace can
appear, and are also used to end Java-style comments (*note Comments::).

     WHITE-SPACE ::= NON-NL-WHITE-SPACE | END-OF-LINE
     NON-NL-WHITE-SPACE ::= a blank, tab, or formfeed character
     END-OF-LINE ::= NEWLINE | CARRIAGE-RETURN
             | CARRIAGE-RETURN NEWLINE
     NEWLINE ::= a newline character
     CARRIAGE-RETURN ::= a carriage return character

4.2 Lexical Pragmas
===================

ESC/Java [Leino-etal00] has a single kind of "lexical pragma", `nowarn',
whose syntax is described below in general terms.  The JML checker
currently ignores these lexical pragmas, but `nowarn' is only
recognized within an annotation.  Note that, unlike ESC/Java, the
semicolon is mandatory.  This restriction seems to be necessary to
prevent lexical ambiguity.

     LEXICAL-PRAGMA ::= NOWARN-PRAGMA
     NOWARN-PRAGMA ::= `nowarn' [ SPACES ] [ NOWARN-LABEL-LIST ] `;'
     SPACES ::= NON-NL-WHITE-SPACE [ NON-NL-WHITE-SPACE ] ...

                  [ `,' [ SPACES ] NOWARN-LABEL [ SPACES ] ] ...
     NOWARN-LABEL ::= LETTER [ LETTER ] ...

4.3 Comments
============

Both kinds of Java comments are allowed in JML: multiline C-style
comments and single line C++-style comments.  However, if what looks
like a comment starts with the at-sign (`@') character, or with a plus
sign and an at-sign (`+@'), then it is considered to be the start of an
annotation by JML, and not a comment.  Furthermore, if what looks like
a comment starts with an asterisk (`*'), then it is a documentation
comment, which is parsed by JML.

     COMMENT ::= C-STYLE-COMMENT | C++-STYLE-COMMENT
     C-STYLE-COMMENT ::= `/*' [ C-STYLE-BODY ] C-STYLE-END
     C-STYLE-BODY ::= NON-AT-PLUS-STAR [ NON-STARS-SLASH ] ...
             | `+' NON-AT [ NON-STARS-SLASH ] ...
             | STARS-NON-SLASH [ NON-STARS-SLASH ] ...
     NON-STARS-SLASH ::= NON-STAR
             | STARS-NON-SLASH
     STARS-NON-SLASH ::= `*' [ `*' ] ... NON-STAR-SLASH
     NON-AT-PLUS-STAR ::= any character except `@', `+', or `*'
     NON-AT ::= any character except `@'
     NON-STAR ::= any character except `*'
     NON-SLASH ::= any character except `/'
     NON-STAR-SLASH ::= any character except `*' or `/'
     C-STYLE-END ::= [ `*' ] ... `*/'
     C++-STYLE-COMMENT ::= `//' [ `+' ] END-OF-LINE
             | `//' NON-AT-PLUS-END-OF-LINE [ NON-END-OF-LINE ] ... END-OF-LINE
             | `//+' NON-AT-END-OF-LINE [ NON-END-OF-LINE ] ... END-OF-LINE
     NON-END-OF-LINE ::= any character except a newline or carriage return
     NON-AT-PLUS-END-OF-LINE ::= any character except `@', `+', newline, or carriage return
     NON-AT-END-OF-LINE ::= any character except `@', newline, or carriage return

4.4 Annotation Markers
======================

If what looks to Java like a comment starts with an at-sign (`@') as
its first character, then it is not considered a comment by JML.  We
refer to the tokens between `//@' and the following END-OF-LINE, and
between pairs of annotation start ( `/*@' or `/*+@' ) and end ( `*/' or
`@*/' or `@+*/' ) markers as "annotations".

   Annotations must hold entire grammatical units of JML specifications,
in the sense that the text of some nonterminals may not be split across
two separate annotations.  For example the following is illegal,
because the POSTCONDITION of the ensures clause is split over two
annotations, and thus each contains a fragment instead of a complete
grammatical unit.
       //@ ensures 0 <= x             // illegal!
       //@      && x < a.length;
   Implementations are not required to check for such errors.  However,
note that ESC/Java [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00] and ESC/Java2 assume that
nonterminals that define clauses are not split into separate
annotations, and so effectively do check for them.

   Annotations look like comments to Java, and are thus ignored by it,
but they are significant to JML.  One way that this can be achieved is
by having JML drop (ie., ignore) the character sequences that are
ANNOTATION-MARKERs: `//@', `//+@', `/*@', `/*+@', and `@+*/', `@*/'.
The at-sign (`@') in `@*/' is optional, and more than one at-sign may
appear in it and the other annotation markers.  However, JML will
recognize JML-KEYWORDS only within annotations.

   Within annotations, on each line, initial white-space and any
immediately following at-signs (`@') are ignored.  The definition of an
annotation marker is given below.

     ANNOTATION-MARKER ::= `//@' [ `@' ] ... | `//+@' [ `@' ] ...
             | `/*@' [ `@' ] ... | `/*+@' [ `@' ] ... | [ `@' ] ... `@+*/' | [ `@' ] ... `*/'
     IGNORED-AT-IN-ANNOTATION ::= `@'

4.5 Documentation Comments
==========================

If what looks like a C-style comment starts with an asterisk (`*') then
it is a "documentation comment".  The syntax is given below.  The
syntax DOC-COMMENT-IGNORED is used for documentation comments that are
ignored by JML.

     DOC-COMMENT ::= `/**' [ `*' ] ... DOC-COMMENT-BODY `*/'
     DOC-COMMENT-IGNORED ::= DOC-COMMENT

   At the level of the rest of the JML grammar, a documentation comment
that does not contain an embedded JML method specification is
essentially described by the above, and the fact that a
DOC-COMMENT-BODY cannot contain the two-character sequence `*/'.

   However, JML and `javadoc' both pay attention to the syntax inside
of these documentation comments.  This syntax is really best described
by a context-free syntax that builds on a lexical syntax.  However,
because much of the documentation is free-form, the context-free syntax
has a lexical flavor to it, and is quite line-oriented.  Thus it should
come as no surprise that the first non-whitespace, non-asterisk (ie.,
not `*') character on a line determines its interpretation.

     DOC-COMMENT-BODY ::= [ DESCRIPTION ] ...
                          [ TAGGED-PARAGRAPH ] ...
                          [ JML-SPECS ]
     DESCRIPTION ::= DOC-NON-EMPTY-TEXTLINE
     TAGGED-PARAGRAPH ::= PARAGRAPH-TAG [ DOC-NON-NL-WS ] ...
                  [ DOC-ATSIGN ] ... [ DESCRIPTION ] ...
     JML-SPECS ::= JML-TAG [ METHOD-SPECIFICATION ] END-JML-TAG
                  [ JML-TAG [ METHOD-SPECIFICATION ] END-JML-TAG ] ...

   The microsyntax or lexical grammar used within documentation comments
is as follows.  Note that the token DOC-NL-WS can only occur at the end
of a line, and is always ignored within documentation comments.
Ignoring DOC-NL-WS means that any asterisks at the beginning of the
next line, even in the part that would be a JML METHOD-SPECIFICATION,
are also ignored.  Otherwise the lexical syntax within a
METHOD-SPECIFICATION is as in the rest of JML.  This method
specification is attached to the following method or constructor
declaration.  (Currently there is no useful way to use such
specifications in the documentation comments for other declarations.)
Note the exception to the grammar of DOC-NON-EMPTY-TEXTLINE.

     PARAGRAPH-TAG ::= `@author' | `@deprecated' | `@exception'
             | `@param' | `@return' | `@see'
             | `@serial' | `@serialdata' | `@serialfield'
             | `@since' | `@throws' | `@version'
             | `@' LETTER [ LETTER ] ...
     DOC-ATSIGN ::= `@'
     DOC-NL-WS ::= END-OF-LINE
               [ DOC-NON-NL-WS ] ... [ `*' [ `*' ] ... [ DOC-NON-NL-WS ] ... ]
     DOC-NON-NL-WS ::= NON-NL-WHITE-SPACE
     DOC-NON-EMPTY-TEXTLINE ::= NON-AT-END-OF-LINE [ NON-END-OF-LINE ] ...
     JML-TAG ::= `<jml>' | `<JML>' | `<esc>' | `<ESC>'
     END-JML-TAG ::= `</jml>' | `</JML>' | `</esc>' | `</ESC>'

   A JML-TAG marks the (temporary) end of a documentation comment and
the beginning of text contributing to a method specification.  The
corresponding END-JML-TAG marks the reverse transition.  The
END-JML-TAG must match the corresponding JML-TAG.

4.6 Tokens
==========

Character strings that are Java reserved words are made into the token
for that reserved word, instead of being made into an IDENT token.
Within an ANNOTATION this also applies to JML-KEYWORDs.  The details
are given below.

     IDENT ::= LETTER [ LETTER-OR-DIGIT ] ...
     LETTER ::= `_', `$', `a' through `z', or `A' through `Z'
     DIGIT ::= `0' | `1' | `2' | `3' | `4' | `5' | `6' | `7' | `8' | `9'
     LETTER-OR-DIGIT ::= LETTER | DIGIT

   Several strings of characters are recognized as keywords or reserved
words in JML. These fall into three separate categories: Java keywords,
JML predicate keywords (which start with a backslash), and JML keywords.
Java keywords are truly reserved words, and are recognized in all
contexts.  The nonterminal JAVA-RESERVED-WORD represents the reserved
words in Java (as in the JDK version 1.4).

   The JML-KEYWORDs are only recognized as keywords when they occur
within an annotation, but outside of a SPEC-EXPRESSION STORE-REF-LIST
or CONSTRAINED-LIST.  JML predicate keywords are also only recognized
within annotations, but they are recognized only inside
SPEC-EXPRESSIONs, STORE-REF-LISTs, and CONSTRAINED-LISTs.

   There are options to the JML tools that extend the language in
various ways.  When an option to parse the syntax for MultiJava
[Clifton-etal00] is in turned on, the word `resend', which is the only
word in the nonterminal MULTIJAVA-RESERVED, is recognized as a reserved
word.  It is thus recognized in all contexts.  When this option is on,
the MULTIJAVA-SEPARATORS (see below) are also recognized.

   Similarly, when an option to parse the syntax for the Universe type
system [Dietl-Mueller05] is used, the words listed in the nonterminal
`java-universe-reserved' also act like reserved words in Java (and are
thus recognized in all contexts).  When an option to recognize the
Universe system syntax in annotations is used, these words instead act
as JML-KEYWORDs and are only recognized in annotations.  However, even
when no Universe options are used, `pure' is recognized as a keyword in
annotations, since it is also a JML-KEYWORD.  (The Universe type system
support in JML is experimental.  Most likely the list of
`java-universe-reserved' will be added to the list of JML-KEYWORDs
eventually.)

   However, even without the Universe option being on, the
`jml-universe-pkeyword' syntax is recognized within JML annotations in
the same way as JML predicate keywords are recognized.

   The details are given below.

     KEYWORD ::= JAVA-RESERVED-WORD
             | JML-PREDICATE-KEYWORD | JML-KEYWORD
     JAVA-RESERVED-WORD ::= `abstract' | `assert'

5 Compilation Units
*******************

A compilation unit in JML is similar to that in Java, with some
additions.  It has the following syntax.

   The COMPILATION-UNIT rule is the start rule for the JML grammar.
(In this syntactic rule and in all other rules in the rest of the body
of this manual, WHITE-SPACE may appear between any two tokens. *Note
Lexical Conventions::, for details.)

TYPE-DEFINITIONs.  *Note Augmenting Method Declarations::, for the
syntax and semantics of MULTIJAVA-TOP-LEVEL-DECLARATION.  *Note
Refinement::, for a discussion of the REFINE-PREFIX and its uses.

   Some JML tools may support various optional extensions to JML.  This
manual partially describes two such extensions: MultiJava
[Clifton-etal00] and the Universe type [Dietl-Mueller05].  Comments in
the grammar indicate optional productions; these are only used by tools
that select an option to parse the syntax in question.  Tools for JML
do not have to support these extensions to JML, and may themselves
support other JML extensions.  In general, JML tools will support a
(hopefully well-documented) variant of the language described in this
manual.

   The Java code in a compilation unit must be legal Java code (or legal
code in the Java extension, such as MultiJava, selected by any options);
in particular it must obey all of Java's static restrictions.  For
example, at most one of the type definitions in a compilation unit may
be declared `public'.  See the `Java Language Specification'
[Gosling-etal00] for details.

   As in Java, JML can be implemented using files to store compilation
units.  When this is done there must also be a correspondence between
the name of any public type defined in a compilation unit and the file
name.  This is done exactly as in Java, although JML allows additional
file name suffixes.  *Note File Name Suffixes::, for details on the
file name suffixes allowed in JML.

   The specification of the compilation unit consists of the
specifications of the TOP-LEVEL-DEFINITIONs it contains, placed in the
declared package (if any).  The interface part of this specification is
determined as in Java [Gosling-etal00] (or as in the Java extension
used).  The specifications of each TYPE-DEFINITION are computed by
starting from an environment that contains the declared package (if
any), each top-level definition in the compilation unit (to allow for
mutual recursion), and the imports [Gosling-etal00].  In JML, not only
is the package `java.lang' implicitly imported, but also there is an
implicit model import of `org.jmlspecs.lang'.  (*Note Import
Definitions::, for the meaning of a model import.)

   Ignoring refinement, a Java compilation unit satisfies such a JML
specification if it satisfies the specified PACKAGE-DEFINITION (if
any), and if for each specified TYPE-DEFINITION, there is a
corresponding Java TYPE-DEFINITION that satisfies that type's JML
specification.  Furthermore, if the JML specification does not contain a
public type, then the Java compilation unit may not contain a public
type.

   The syntax and semantics of PACKAGE-DEFINITIONs and
IMPORT-DEFINITIONs are discussed in the subsections below.

5.1 Package Definitions
=======================

The syntax of a PACKAGE-DEFINITION is as in Java [Gosling-etal00].

     PACKAGE-DEFINITION ::= `package' NAME `;'
     NAME ::= IDENT  [ `.' IDENT ] ...

   A Java package definition satisfies the JML specification only if it
is the same as that specified.  That is, the Java code has to be the
same (modulo WHITE-SPACE) as the JML specification.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Import Definitions,  Prev: Package Definitions,  Up: Compilation Units

5.2 Import Definitions
======================

The syntax of a IMPORT-DEFINITION is as follows.  The only difference
from the Java syntax [Gosling-etal00] is the optional `model' modifier.

     IMPORT-DEFINITION ::= [ `model' ] `import' NAME-STAR `;'
     NAME-STAR ::= IDENT [ `.' IDENT ] ... [ `.' `*' ]

   An IMPORT-DEFINITION may use the `model' modifier if and only if the
whole IMPORT-DEFINITION is entirely contained within a single
annotation. For example, the following is illegal.

     `/*@ model @*/ import com.foo.*; // illegal!'

To write an import that affects both the JML annotations and Java code,
just use a normal java import, without using the `model' modifier.

   The effect on the interface computed for a compilation unit of an
IMPORT-DEFINITION without the `model' keyword is the same as in Java
[Gosling-etal00].  Such import directives affect the computation of the
interface of the Java code as well as the JML specification (that is,
they apply to both equally).

   When the `model' keyword is used, the import only has an effect on
the JML annotations (and not on the Java code).  The abbreviation
permitted by the use of such an import, however, is the same as would
be effected by a normal Java import.  Such model imports can affect the
computation of the interface of the JML specification by being used in
the declarations of model and ghost features.

   Both normal Java and model imports do not themselves contribute to
the interface of a JML specification.  As such, they do not have to be
present in a correct implementation of the specification.  An
implementation could, for example, use different forms of import, or it
could use fully qualified names instead of imports, and achieve the
same effect as using the imports in the specification.

6 Type Definitions
******************

The following is the syntax of type definitions.

     TYPE-DEFINITION ::= CLASS-DEFINITION
             | INTERFACE-DEFINITION
             | `;'

   The specification of a TYPE-DEFINITION is determined as follows.  If
the TYPE-DEFINITION consists only of a semicolon (`;'), then the
specification is empty.  Otherwise the specification is that of the
class or interface definition.  Such a specification must be satisfied
by the corresponding class or interface definition.

   The rest of this chapter discusses class and interface definitions,
as well as the syntax of modifiers.

6.1 Class and Interface Definitions
===================================

Class and interface definitions are quite similar, as interfaces may be
seen as a special kind of class definition that only allows the
declaration of abstract instance methods and final static fields (in
the Java code [Gosling-etal00]).  Their syntax is also similar.

     CLASS-DEFINITION ::= [ DOC-COMMENT ] MODIFIERS `class' IDENT
                 [ CLASS-EXTENDS-CLAUSE ] [ IMPLEMENTS-CLAUSE ]
                 CLASS-BLOCK
     CLASS-BLOCK ::= `{' [ FIELD ] ... `}'

     INTERFACE-DEFINITION ::= [ DOC-COMMENT ] MODIFIERS `interface' IDENT
                [ INTERFACE-EXTENDS ]
                CLASS-BLOCK

JML specification information.  *Note Documentation Comments::, for the
syntax of documentation comments.

   *Note Class and Interface Member Declarations::, for the syntax and
semantics of FIELDs, which form the essence of classes and interfaces.

   The rest of this section discusses subtyping for classes and
interfaces and also the particular modifiers used in classes and
interfaces.

6.1.1 Subtyping for Type Definitions
------------------------------------

Classes in Java can use single inheritance and may also implement any
number of interfaces.  Interfaces may extend any number of other
interfaces.

     CLASS-EXTENDS-CLAUSE ::= [ `extends' NAME [ `weakly' ] ]
     IMPLEMENTS-CLAUSE ::= `implements' NAME-WEAKLY-LIST
     NAME-WEAKLY-LIST ::= NAME [ `weakly' ] [ `,' NAME [ `weakly' ] ] ...
     INTERFACE-EXTENDS ::= `extends' NAME-WEAKLY-LIST

   The meaning of inheritance in JML is similar to that in Java.  In
Java, a when class S names a class T in S's CLASS-EXTENDS-CLAUSE, then
S is a "subclass" of T and T is a "superclass" of S; we also say that S
"inherits" from T.  This relationship also makes S a "subtype" of T,
meaning that variables of type T can refer to objects of type S.  In
Java, when S is a subclass of T, then S inherits all the instance
fields and methods from T.

   A class may also implement several interfaces, declared in its
IMPLEMENTS-CLAUSE; the class thus becomes a subtype of each of the
interfaces that it implements.

   Similarly, an interface may extend several other interfaces.  In
Java, such an interface inherits all of the abstract methods and static
final fields from the interfaces it extends.  When interface U extends
another interface V, then U is a subtype of V.

   In JML, model and ghost features, as well as specifications are
inherited.  A subtype inherits from its supertypes:
   * all instance fields, including model and ghost fields,

   * instance methods are also inherited and their specifications,

   * instance invariants and instance history constraints.

   It is an error for a type to inherit a field x from two different
supertypes if that field is declared with different types.

   It is an error for a type to inherit a method with the same formal
parameter types but with either different return types or with
conflicting throws clauses [Gosling-etal00].  (There are other
restrictions on method inheritance that apply when MultiJava is used
[Clifton-etal00].)

   In Java one cannot inherit method implementations from interfaces,
but this is possible in JML, where one can implement a model method in
an interface.  It is illegal for a class or interface to inherit two
different implementations of a model method.

   In JML, instance methods have to obey the specifications of all
methods they override.  This, together with the inheritance of
invariants and history constraints, forces subtypes to be behavioral
subtypes [Dhara-Leavens96] [Leavens-Naumann06] [Leavens06b].  However,
history constraints are not inherited from supertypes whose names are
marked with `weakly' in the relevant clause.  Such subtypes are "weak
behavioral subtypes", and should only be used in ways that do not
permit cross-type aliasing [Dhara-Leavens94b] [Dhara97].

   See the report, "Desugaring JML Method Specifications"
[Raghavan-Leavens05] for more about the details of specification
inheritance in JML.

6.1.2 Modifiers for Type Definitions
------------------------------------

In addition to the Java modifiers that can be legally attached to a
class or interface definition [Gosling-etal00], in JML one can use the
following modifiers.
       pure model
       spec_java_math spec_safe_math spec_bigint_math
       code_java_math code_safe_math code_bigint_math
       nullable_by_default
   *Note Modifiers::, for the syntax and semantics of modifiers in
general.

   A type definition may be modified with the JML modifier keyword
`pure'.  The effect of declaring a type `pure' is that all constructor
and instance method declarations within the type are automatically
declared to be pure (*note Pure Methods and Constructors::, for more
about pure methods).  Hence, once an object of a class is created, it
will be immutable, and furthermore, none of its instance methods will
have any side effects.  However, its static methods may still have side
effects, as the `pure' does not apply to the static methods declared in
a type.  Furthermore, although an override of a pure method must be
pure, instance methods declared in subtypes that do not override this
supertype's methods need not be pure.  Hence, such a subtype does not
necessarily have immutable objects.  So, in essence, declaring a class
pure is merely a shorthand for declaring all of the constructors and
instance methods pure.

   [[[ Pure does not make a class immutable either, since a method might
return a reference to an internal representation which is then modified
by some non-pure method in its class.  Is it sufficient if all fields
are also fields of pure types (recursively)?  Then there are arrays.
And also all fields would need to be private to have immutability. -
DRC ]]]

   A type declaration that is declared with the modifier `model' is a
specification-only type.  Hence, such a type may not be used in Java
code, and may only be used in annotations.  It follows that the entire
type definition must be contained within an annotation comment, and
consequently annotations within the type definition do not need to be
separately enclosed in annotation comments, as is demonstrated in the
example below.  The scope rules for a model type definition are the
same as for Java type definitions, except that a model type definition
is not in scope for any Java code, only for annotations.

   [[[Model types are seldom used in JML.  Since the runtime assertion
checker doesn't work with them, I wonder if it would be best to get rid
of them completely.  You could always just define a Java type, which
would be useful for runtime assertion checking.]]]

   [[[ May a model type definition appear in more than one
specification file of a refinement sequence, with any member
declarations being combined together?  I'd prefer that it only be
allowed to appear once and be required to be completely defined in one
spec file - easier for tools.  - DRCok ]]]

6.2 Modifiers
=============

The following is the syntax of modifiers.

     MODIFIERS ::= [ MODIFIER ] ...
     MODIFIER ::= `public' | `protected' | `private'
             | `abstract' | `static' |
             | `final' | `synchronized'
             | `transient' | `volatile'
             | `native' | `strictfp'
             | `const'             // reserved but not used in Java
             | JML-MODIFIER
     JML-MODIFIER ::= `spec_public' | `spec_protected'
             | `model' | `ghost' | `pure'
             | `instance' | `helper'
             | `uninitialized'
             | `spec_java_math' | `spec_safe_math' | `spec_bigint_math'
             | `code_java_math' | `code_safe_math' | `code_bigint_math'
             | `non_null' | `nullable' | `nullable_by_default'
             | `extract'

   The JML-MODIFIERS are only recognized as keywords in annotation
comments.  *Note Lexical Conventions::, for more details.

   The Java modifiers have the same meaning as in Java [Gosling-etal00].

   Note that although the MODIFIERS grammar non-terminal is used in
many places throughout the grammar, not all modifiers can be used with
every grammar construct.  See the discussion regarding each grammar
construct, which is summarized in *Note Modifier Summary::.

   In the following we first discuss the suggested ordering of modifiers
The rest of this section discusses the JML-specific modifiers in
general terms.  Their use and meaning for each kind of grammatical
construct should be consulted directly for more details.

6.2.1 Suggested Modifier Ordering
---------------------------------

There are various guidelines for ordering modifiers in Java
[[[citations?]]].  As JML has several extra modifiers, we also suggest
an ordering; although this ordering is not enforced, various tools may
give warnings if the suggestions are not followed, as following a
standard ordering tends to make reading declarations easier.  For use
in JML, we suggest the following ordering groups, where the ones at the
top should appear first (leftmost), and the ones at the bottom should
appear last (rightmost).  In each line, the modifiers are either
mutually exclusive, or their order does not matter (or both).

       public private protected spec_public spec_protected
       abstract static
       model ghost pure
       final synchronized
       instance helper
       transient volatile

       spec_java_math spec_safe_math spec_bigint_math

       peer rep readonly


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Spec Public,  Next: Spec Protected,  Prev: Suggested Modifier Ordering,  Up: Modifiers

6.2.2 Spec Public
-----------------

The `spec_public' modifier allows one to declare a feature as public
for specification purposes.  It can only be used when the feature has a
more restrictive visibility in Java.  A `spec_public' field is also
implicitly a data group.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Spec Protected,  Next: Pure,  Prev: Spec Public,  Up: Modifiers

6.2.3 Spec Protected
--------------------

The `spec_protected' modifier allows one to declare a feature as
protected for specification purposes.  It can only be used when the
feature has a more restrictive visibility in Java.  That is, it can
only be used to change the visibility of a field or method that is, for
Java, either declared `private' or default access (package visible).
A `spec_protected' field is also implicitly a data group.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Pure,  Next: Model,  Prev: Spec Protected,  Up: Modifiers

6.2.4 Pure
----------

In general terms, a "pure" feature is one that has no side effects when
executed.  In essence `pure' only applies to methods and constructors.
The use of `pure' for a type definition is shorthand for applying that
modifier to all constructors and instance methods in the type (*note
Modifiers for Type Definitions::).

   *Note Pure Methods and Constructors::, for the exact semantics of
pure methods and constructors.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Model,  Next: Ghost,  Prev: Pure,  Up: Modifiers

6.2.5 Model
-----------

The `model' modifier introduces a specification-only feature.  For
fields it also has a special meaning, which is that the field can be
represented by concrete fields.  *Note Model and Ghost::.

   The modifiers `model' and `ghost' are mutually exclusive.

   A `model' field may not be declared to be `final'.  This is because
model fields are abstractions of concrete fields, and thus it would
complicate JML to allow final model fields.  If you feel that you want
a final model field, what you should use instead is a final ghost
field. *Note Ghost::.

   Note that in an interface, a model field is implicitly declared to
be `static'.  Thus if you want an instance field, you should use the
modifier `instance', so that the field will act as if it were a member
of all objects whose type is a subtype of that interface.  Conversely,
in a class, a model field is implicitly declared to be `instance'.
Thus, if you want a static field, you should use the modifier `static',
so that the value of the model field is shared by all instances of the
class and its subclasses.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Ghost,  Next: Instance,  Prev: Model,  Up: Modifiers

6.2.6 Ghost
-----------

The `ghost' modifier introduces a specification-only field that is
maintained by special set statements.  *Note Model and Ghost::.

   The modifiers `ghost' and `model' are mutually exclusive.

   A ghost field declared in an interface is not `final' by default.
If you want a final `ghost' field in an interface, you must declare it
to be `final' explicitly.  Ghost fields in classes are also not final
by default.

   In an interface, a ghost field is implicitly declared to be
`static'.  Thus if you want an instance field, you should use the
modifier `instance', so that the field will act as if it were a member
of all objects whose type is a subtype of that interface.  Conversely,
in a class, a ghost field is implicitly declared to be `instance'.
Thus, if you want a static field, you should use the modifier `static',
so that the value of the ghost field is shared by all instances of the
class and its subclasses.

6.2.7 Instance
--------------

The `instance' modifier says that a field is not static.  *Note
Instance vs. Static::.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Helper,  Next: Monitored,  Prev: Instance,  Up: Modifiers

6.2.8 Helper
------------

The `helper' modifier may be used on a private method or constructor to
say that its specification is not augmented by invariants and history
constraints that would otherwise be relevant.  Normally, an invariant
applies to all methods in a class or interface.  However, an exception
is made for methods and constructors declared with the `helper'
modifier.  *Note Invariants::.   [[[ Just on private? or just on
non-overridable methods? or just on non-overridden methods? - DRC]]]


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Monitored,  Next: Uninitialized,  Prev: Helper,  Up: Modifiers

6.2.9 Monitored
---------------

The `monitored' modifier may be used on a non-model field declaration
to say that a thread must hold the lock on the object that contains the
field (i.e., the `this' object containing the field) before it may read
or write the field [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00].


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Uninitialized,  Next: Math Modifiers,  Prev: Monitored,  Up: Modifiers

6.2.10 Uninitialized
--------------------

The `uninitialized' modifier may be used on a field declaration to say
that despite the initializer, the location declared is to be considered
uninitialized.  Thus, the field should be assigned in each path before
it is read.  [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00].

[[[Need explanation of these.]]]


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Nullity Modifiers,  Prev: Math Modifiers,  Up: Modifiers

6.2.12 Nullity Modifiers
------------------------

Any declaration (other than that of a local variable) whose type is a
reference type is implicitly declared `non_null' unless (explicitly or
implicitly) declared `nullable'. Hence reference type declarations are
assumed to be non-null by default (*note Null is Not the Default::).

   A declaration can be "explicitly" declared `nullable' by annotating
it with the `nullable' modifier.  A declaration is "implicitly"
declared `nullable' when the (outer most) class or interface containing
the declaration is adorned by the class-level modifier
`nullable_by_default'.

   Attempting to use both the `non_null' and `nullable' modifiers is a
compile time error.

7.1.1 Method and Constructor Declarations
-----------------------------------------

The following is the syntax of a method declaration.

     METHOD-DECL ::= [ DOC-COMMENT ] ...
                     METHOD-SPECIFICATION
                     MODIFIERS [ METHOD-OR-CONSTRUCTOR-KEYWORD ]
                     [ TYPE-SPEC ] METHOD-HEAD
                     METHOD-BODY
             | [ DOC-COMMENT ] ...
               MODIFIERS METHOD-OR-CONSTRUCTOR-KEYWORD
               [ TYPE-SPEC ] METHOD-HEAD
               [ METHOD-SPECIFICATION ]
               METHOD-BODY
     METHOD-OR-CONSTRUCTOR-KEYWORD ::= `method' | `constructor'
     METHOD-HEAD ::= IDENT FORMALS [ DIMS ] [ THROWS-CLAUSE ]
     METHOD-BODY ::= COMPOUND-STATEMENT | `;'
     THROWS-CLAUSE ::= `throws' NAME [ `,' NAME ] ...

   Notice that the specification of a method (*note Method
Specifications::) may appear either before or after the METHOD-HEAD.

   The use of `non_null' as a MODIFIER in a METHOD-DECL really is
shorthand for a postcondition describing the normal result of a method,
indicating that it must not be null.   It can also be seen as a
modifier on the method's result type, saying that the type returned
does not contain null.

   The use of `extract' as a MODIFIER in a METHOD-DECL is shorthand for
writing a model program specification.  *Note Extracting Model Program
Specifications::, for an explanation of this modifier.

.........................

     FORMALS ::= `(' [ PARAM-DECLARATION-LIST ] `)'
     PARAM-DECLARATION-LIST ::= PARAM-DECLARATION
                                [ `,' PARAM-DECLARATION ] ...

   *Note Type-Specs::, for more about the nonterminals TYPE-SPEC and
DIMS.  *Note MultiMethods::, for details of MULTIJAVA-PARAM-DECLARATION.

   The modifier `non_null' when attached to a formal parameter is
shorthand for a precondition that says that the corresponding actual
parameter may not be null.  The type of a parameter that has the
`non_null' modifier must be a reference type [Raghavan-Leavens05].

   The `non_null' modifier on a parameter is inherited in the same way
as the equivalent precondition would be, so it need not be declared on
every declaration of the same method in a subtype or refinement.  The
`non_null' modifier may be added to a method in a refinement file
(*note Refinement::), and thus does not have to appear in any
particular file in a refinement sequence.  It can be added to a method
override in a subtype, but that will generally make the method
non-implementable, as the method must also satisfy an inherited
specification without the corresponding precondition.

7.1.1.2 Model Methods and Constructors
......................................

A method or constructor that uses the modifier `model' is called a
"model method or constructor".  Since a model method is not visible to
Java code, the entire method, including its body, should be written in
an annotation.

   As usual in JML (*note Model and Ghost::), a model method or
constructor is a specification-only feature.  A model method or
constructor may have either a body or a specification, or both.  The
specification may be used in various verification tools, while the body
allows it to be executed during runtime assertion checking.  Model
methods may also be abstract, and both model methods and constructors
may be final.

   [[[ Can constructors be final?  Why? - DRC ]]]

   It is usual in JML to declare model methods and constructors as
`pure'.  However, it is possible to have a model method or constructor
that is not pure; such methods are useful in model programs (*note
Model Programs::).  On the other hand, aside from their use in model
programs, most model methods only exist to be called in assertions, and
since only pure methods can be called in assertions, they should
usually be declared as `pure'.

7.1.1.3 Pure Methods and Constructors
.....................................

This subsubsection, which describes the effect of the `pure' modifier
on methods and constructor declarations, is quoted from the preliminary
design document [Leavens-Baker-Ruby06].

   We say a method is "pure" if it is either specified with the
modifier `pure' or is a method that appears in the specification of a
`pure' interface or class.  Similarly, a constructor is pure if it is
either specified with the modifier `pure' or appears in the
specification of a `pure' class.

   A "pure method" that is not a constructor implicitly has a
specification that does not allow any side-effects.  That is, its
specification has the clauses
                diverges false;
                assignable \nothing;
added to each specification case; if the method has no
specification given explicitly, then these clauses are added as a
lightweight specification.  For this reason, if one is writing a pure
method, it is not necessary to otherwise specify an assignable clause
(*note Assignable Clauses::), although doing so may improve the
specification's clarity.

   A "pure constructor" has the clauses
                diverges false;
                assignable this.*;
added to each specification case; if the constructor has no
specification given explicitly, then these clauses are added as a
lightweight specification.  This specification allows the constructor
to assign to the non-static fields of the class in which it appears
(including those inherited from its superclasses and ghost model
instance fields from the interfaces that it implements).

   Implementations of pure methods and constructors will be checked to
see that they meet these conditions on what locations they can assign
to.  To make such checking modular, some JML tools prohibit a pure
method or constructor implementation from calling methods or
constructors that are not pure.  However, more sophisticated tools
could more directly check the intended semantics [Salcianu-Rinard05].

   A pure method or constructor must also be provably terminating.
Although JML does not force users to make such proofs of termination,
users writing pure methods and constructors are supposed to make pure
methods total in the sense that whenever, a pure method is called it
either returns normally or throws some exception.  This is supposed to
lessen the possibility that assertion evaluation could loop forever,
aids the runtime assertion checker, which turns exceptions into
arbitrary values of the appropriate result type, and helps make pure
methods more like mathematical functions for verification purposes.
[[[ I think this has changed - exceptions in a pure method make the
result undefined, not arbitrary - DRC]]]

   Furthermore, a pure method is supposed to always either terminate
normally or throw an exception, even for calls that do not satisfy its
precondition.  Static verification tools for JML should enforce this
condition, by requiring a proof that a pure method implementation
satisfies the following specification
        private behavior
          requires true;
          diverges false;
          assignable \nothing;
(and similarly for constructors, except that the assignable clause
becomes `assignable this.*;' for constructors).

   However, this implicit verification condition is a specification,
and thus cannot be used in reasoning about calls to the method, even
calls from within the class itself and recursive calls from within the
implementation.  For this reason we recommend writing the method or
constructor specification in such a way that the effective precondition
of the method is "true," making the proof of the above implicit
verification condition trivial, and allowing the termination behavior
of the implementation to be relied upon by all clients.

   Recursion is permitted, both in the implementation of pure methods
and the data structures they manipulate, and in the specifications of
pure methods.  When recursion is used in a specification, the proof of
well-formedness for the specification involves the use of JML's
`measured_by' clause.

   Since a pure method may not go into an infinite loop, if it has a
non-trivial precondition, it should throw an exception when its normal
precondition is not met.  This exceptional behavior does not have to be
specified or programmed explicitly, but technically there is an
obligation to meet the specification that the method never loops
forever.

   Furthermore, a pure method must be deterministic, in the sense that
when called in a given state, it must always return the same value.
Similarly a pure constructor should be deterministic in the sense that
when called in a given state, it always initializes the object in the
same way.

   A pure method can be declared in any class or interface, and a pure
constructor can be declared in any class.  JML will specify the pure
methods and constructors in the standard Java libraries as pure.

   As a convenience, instead of writing `pure' on each method declared
in a class and interface, one can use the modifier `pure' on classes and
interfaces and classes.  This simply means that each non-static method
and each constructor declared in such a class or interface is `pure'.
Note that this does not mean that all methods inherited (but not
declared in and hence not overridden in) the class or interface are
pure.  For example, every class inherits ultimately from
`java.lang.Object', which has some methods, such as `notify' and
`notifyAll' that are manifestly not pure.  Thus each class will have
some methods that are not pure.  Despite this, it is convenient to
refer to classes and interfaces declared with the `pure' modifier as
"pure".

   In JML the modifiers `model' and `pure' are orthogonal.  (Recall
something declared with the modifier `model' does not have to be
implemented, and is used purely for specification purposes.)
Therefore, one can have a model method that is not pure (these might be
useful in JML's model programs) and a pure method that is not a model
method.  Nevertheless, usually a model method (or constructor) should
be pure, since there is no way to use non-pure methods in an assertion,
and model methods cannot be used in normal Java code.

   By the same reasoning, model classes should, in general, also be
pure.  Model classes cannot be used in normal Java code, and hence their
methods are only useful in assertions (and JML's model programs).
Hence it is typical, although not required, that a model class also be
a pure class.

   As can be seen from the semantics, if a pure method has a return
type of `void', then it can essentially only do nothing.  So, while
pure methods with `void' as their return type are not illegal, they are
useless.

7.1.1.4 Helper Methods and Constructors
.......................................

The `helper' modifier may only be used on a private method or
constructor.  [[[ This restriction needs to be clarified - ESC/Java
limits helper to non-overridable methods. ]]] Such a helper method or
constructor has a specification that is not augmented by invariants and
history constraints that would otherwise apply to it.  It can thus be
thought of as not really a method or constructor, but merely an
abbreviation device.  However, whatever specifications are given
explicitly for such a method or constructor still apply.  *Note
Invariants::, for more details.

7.1.2 Field and Variable Declarations
-------------------------------------

The following is the syntax of field and variable declarations.

     VARIABLE-DEFINITION ::= [ DOC-COMMENT ] ... MODIFIERS VARIABLE-DECLS
     VARIABLE-DECLS ::= [ `field' ] TYPE-SPEC VARIABLE-DECLARATORS `;'
                        [ JML-DATA-GROUP-CLAUSE ] ...
     VARIABLE-DECLARATORS ::= VARIABLE-DECLARATOR
                              [ `,' VARIABLE-DECLARATOR ] ...
     VARIABLE-DECLARATOR ::= IDENT [ DIMS ] [ `=' INITIALIZER ]
     INITIALIZER ::= EXPRESSION | ARRAY-INITIALIZER
     ARRAY-INITIALIZER ::= `{' [ INITIALIZER-LIST ] `}'
     INITIALIZER-LIST ::= INITIALIZER [ `,' INITIALIZER ] ... [ `,' ]

   The `field' keyword is not normally needed, but can be used to
change JML's parsing mode.  Within an annotation, such as within a
declaration of a model method, it is sometimes necessary to switch from
JML annotation mode to JML spec-expression mode, in order to parse
words that are JML keywords but should be recognized as Java
identifiers.  This can be accomplished in a field declaration by using
the keyword `field', which changes parsing to spec-expression mode.
[[[ When does the mode revert back?  e.g. in a method declaration -
DRC]]]

   [[[Needs example, move elsewhere?]]]

   In a non-Java file, such as a file with suffix `.refines-java'
(*note Refinement::), one may omit the initializer of a
VARIABLE-DECLARATOR, even one declared to be `final'.  In such a file,
one may also omit the body of a METHOD-DECL.  Of course, in a `.java'
file, one must obey all the rules of Java for declarations that are not
in annotations.

7.1.2.1 JML Modifiers for Fields
................................

The `ghost' and `model' modifiers for fields both say that the field is
a specification-only field; it thus cannot be accessed by the Java
code.  The difference is that a ghost field is explicitly manipulated
by initializations and set statements (*note Statements and Annotation
Statements::), whereas a model field cannot be explicitly manipulated.
Instead a model field is indirectly given a value by a represents clause
(*note Represents Clauses::).  *Note Model and Ghost::, for a general
discussion of this distinction in JML.

   While fields can be declared as either model or ghost fields, a field
cannot be both.  Furthermore, local variables cannot be declared with
the `model' modifier.

   The `non_null' modifier in a variable declaration is shorthand for
an invariant saying that each variable declared in the VARIABLE-DECLS
may not be null.  This invariant has the same visibility as the
visibility declaration of the VARIABLE-DEFINITION itself. *Note
Invariants::, for more about invariants.

   The `monitored' modifier says that each variable declared in the
VARIABLE-DECLS can only be accessed by a thread that holds the lock on
the object that contains the field [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00].  It may not
be used with model fields.

   The `instance' modifier says that the field is to be found in
instances instead of in class objects; it is the opposite of `static'.
It is typically only needed for model or ghost fields declared in
interfaces.  When used in an interface, it makes the field both
non-static and non-final (unless the `final' modifier is used
explicitly).  *Note Instance vs. Static::.  [[[ So how does one declare
a static non-final field in an interface? - DRC ]]]

7.1.2.2 Type-Specs
..................

The syntax of a TYPE-SPEC is as in Java [Gosling-etal00], except for
the addition of the type `\TYPE' and the possibility of using
OWNERSHIP-MODIFIERS.  The OWNERSHIP-MODIFIERS are only available when
the Universe type system is turned on.  *Note Universe Type System::,
for how to do that, and for the syntax and semantics of
OWNERSHIP-MODIFIERS.

     TYPE-SPEC ::= [ OWNERSHIP-MODIFIERS ] TYPE [ DIMS ]
              | `\TYPE' [ DIMS ]
     TYPE ::= REFERENCE-TYPE | BUILT-IN-TYPE
     REFERENCE-TYPE ::= NAME
     DIMS ::= ``['' ``]'' [ ``['' ``]'' ] ...

   The type `\TYPE' represents the kind of all Java types.  It can only
be used in annotations.  It is equivalent to `java.lang.Class'.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Class Initializer Declarations,  Prev: Java Member Declarations,  Up: Class and Interface Member Declarations

7.2 Class Initializer Declarations
==================================

The following is the syntax of class initializers.

     CLASS-INITIALIZER-DECL ::= [ METHOD-SPECIFICATION ]
                                [ `static' ] COMPOUND-STATEMENT
             | METHOD-SPECIFICATION `static_initializer'
             | METHOD-SPECIFICATION `initializer'

   The first form above is the form of Java class instance and static
initializers.  The initializer is static, and thus run when the class
is loaded, if it is labeled `static'. The effect of the initializer can
be specified by a JML method specification (*note Method
Specifications::), which treats the initializer as a private helper
method with return type `void', whose body is given by the
COMPOUND-STATEMENT (*note Statements and Annotation Statements::).

   The last two forms are used in JML to specify static and instance
initializers without giving the body of the initializer.  They would be
used in annotations in non-Java files (*note Refinement::).  At most
one of each of these may appear in a type specification file.  Such a
specification is satisfied if there is at least one corresponding
initializer in the implementation, and if the sequential composition of
the bodies of the corresponding initializer(s), when considered as the
body of a private helper method with return type `void', satisfy the
specification given (*note Method Specifications::).

   Note that, due to this semantics, the METHOD-SPECIFICATIONs for an
initializer can only have private specification cases.

   [[[ But initializers can be interspersed between field
initializations, which will affect their meaning.  Thus I think the
composition has to include the field initializations.  The effect is
that the post-condition of the JML initializer refers to the state
before a constructor begins executing; a static_initializer refers to
the state after class loading, I think. - DRCok ]]] [[[ Is the
restriction to private true for static initialization as well - don't
think it should be. - DRCOk ]]]

8 Type Specifications
*********************

This chapter describes the way JML can be used to specify abstract data
types (ADTs).

   Overall the mechanisms used in JML to specify ADTs can be described
as follows.  First, the interface of a type is described using the Java
syntax for such a type's declaration (*note Class and Interface Member
Declarations::); this includes any required fields and methods, along
with their types and visibilities, etc.  Second, the behavior of a type
is described by declaring model and ghost fields to be the client (or
subtype) visible abstractions of the concrete state of the objects of
that type, by writing method specifications using those fields, and by
writing various JML-DECLARATIONs to further refine the logical model
defined by these fields.  These JML-DECLARATIONs can also be used to
record various design and implementation decisions.

   The syntax of these JML-DECLARATIONs is as follows.

     JML-DECLARATION ::= MODIFIERS INVARIANT
             | MODIFIERS HISTORY-CONSTRAINT
             | MODIFIERS REPRESENTS-CLAUSE
             | MODIFIERS INITIALLY-CLAUSE
             | MODIFIERS MONITORS-FOR-CLAUSE
             | MODIFIERS READABLE-IF-CLAUSE
             | MODIFIERS WRITABLE-IF-CLAUSE
             | AXIOM-CLAUSE

   The semantics of each of kind of JML-DECLARATION is discussed in the
sections below.  However, before getting to the details, we start with
some introductory examples.

8.2 Invariants
==============

The syntax of an invariant declaration is as follows.

     INVARIANT ::= INVARIANT-KEYWORD PREDICATE `;'
     INVARIANT-KEYWORD ::= `invariant' | `invariant_redundantly'

   An example of an invariant is given below.  The invariant in the
example has default (package) visibility, and says that in every state
that is a visible state for an object of type `Invariant', the object's
field `b' is not null and the array it refers to has exactly 6 elements.
In this example, no postcondition is necessary for the constructor
since the invariant is an implicit postcondition for it.

     package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

     public abstract class Invariant {

         boolean[] b;

         //@ invariant b != null && b.length == 6;

         //@ assignable b;
         Invariant() {
             b = new boolean[6];
         }
     }

   Invariants are properties that have to hold in all visible states.
The notion of visible state is of crucial importance in the explanation
of the semantics of both invariants and constraints.  A state is a
"visible state" for an object o if it is the state that occurs at one
of these moments in a program's execution:

   * at end of a non-helper constructor invocation that is initializing
     o,

   * at the beginning of a non-helper finalizer invocation that is
     finalizing o,

   * at the beginning or end of a non-helper non-static non-finalizer
     method invocation with o as the receiver,

   * at the beginning or end of a non-helper static method invocation
     for a method in o's class or some superclass of o's class, or

   * when no constructor, destructor, non-static method invocation with
     o as receiver, or static method invocation for a method in o's
     class or some superclass of o's class is in progress.

Note that visible states for an object o do not include states at the
beginning and end of invocations of "helpers": constructors or methods
declared with the `helper' modifier (*note Helper methods and
constructors::).  Thus the post-state of a helper constructor and the
pre- and post-states of helper methods are not visible states.

   A state is a "visible state" for a type T if it occurs after static
initialization for T is complete and it is a visible state for some
object that has type T.

   JML distinguishes "static" and "instance" invariants.  These are
mutually exclusive and any invariant is either a static or instance
invariant.  An invariant may be explicitly declared to be static or
instance by using one of the modifiers `static' or `instance' in the
declaration of the invariant.  An invariant declared in a class
declaration is, by default, an instance invariant.  An invariant
declared in an interface declaration is, by default, a static invariant.

   For example, the invariant declared in the class `Invariant' above
is an instance invariant, because it occurs inside a class declaration.
If `Invariant' had been an interface instead of a class, then this
invariant would have been a static invariant.

   A static invariant may only refer to static fields of an object.  An
instance invariant, on the other hand, may refer to both static and
non-static fields.

   The distinction between static and instance invariants also affects
when the invariants are supposed to hold.  A static invariant declared
in a type T must hold in every state that is a visible state for type
T.  An instance invariant declared in a type T must hold for every
object o of type T, for every state that is a visible state for o.

   For reasoning about invariants we make a distinction between
assuming, establishing, and preserving an invariant.  A method or
constructor "assumes" an invariant if the invariant must hold in its
pre-state.  A method or constructor "establishes" an invariant if the
invariant must hold in its post-state.  A method or constructor
"preserves" an invariant if the invariant is both assumed and
established.

   JML's verification logic enforces invariants by making sure that
each non-helper method, constructor, or finalizer:
   * assumes the static invariants of all types, T, for which its
     pre-state is a visible state for T,

   * establishes the static invariants of all types, T, for which its
     post-state is a visible state for T,

   * assumes the instance invariants of all objects, o, for which its
     pre-state is a visible state for o, and

   * establishes the instance invariants of all objects, o, for which
     its post-state is a visible state for o.

   This means that each non-helper constructor found in a class C
preserves the static invariants of all types, including C, that have
finished their static initialization, establishes the instance
invariant of the object under construction, and, modulo creation and
deletion of objects, preserves the instance invariants of all other
objects.  (Objects that are created by a constructor must have their
instance invariant established; and objects that are deleted by the
action of the constructor can be assumed to satisfy their instance
invariant in the constructor's pre-state.)  Note in particular that, at
the beginning of a constructor invocation, the instance invariant of
the object being initialized does not have to hold yet.

   Furthermore, each non-helper non-static method found in a type T
preserves the static invariants of all types that have finished their
static initialization, including T, and, modulo creation and deletion
of objects, preserves the instance invariants of all objects, in
particular the receiver object.  However, finalizers do only assume the
instance invariant of the receiver object, and do not have to establish
it on exit.

   The semantics given above is highly non-modular, but is in general
necessary for the enforcement of invariance when no mechanisms are
available to prevent aliasing problems, or when constructs like
(concrete) public fields are used [Poetzsch-Heffter97].  Of course, one
would like to enforce invariants in a more modular way.  By a modular
enforcement of invariants, we mean that one could verify each type
independently of the types that it does not use, and that a well-formed
program put together from such verified types would still satisfy the
semantics for invariants given above.  That is, each type would be
responsible for the enforcement of the invariants it declares and would
be able to assume, without checking, the invariants of other types it
uses.

   To accomplish this ideal, it seems that some mechanism for object
ownership and alias control [Noble-Vitek-Potter98]
[Mueller-Poetzsch-Heffter00] [Mueller-Poetzsch-Heffter00a]
[Mueller-Poetzsch-Heffter01a] [Mueller02]
[Mueller-Poetzsch-Heffter-Leavens03] is necessary.  However, this
mechanism is still not a part of JML, although some design work in this
direction has taken place [Mueller-Poetzsch-Heffter-Leavens06].

   On the other hand, people generally assume that there are no object
ownership alias problems; this is perhaps a reasonable strategy for some
tools, like run-time assertion checkers, to take.  The alternative,
tracking which types and objects are in visible states, and checking
every applicable invariant for every type and object in a visible state,
is obviously impractical.

   Therefore, assuming or ignoring the problems with object ownership
and alias control, one obtains a simple and more modular way to check
invariants.  This is as follows.
   * Each non-helper constructor declared in a class C, must preserve
     the static invariant of C, if C is finished with its static
     initialization, and must establish the instance invariant of the
     object being constructed.

   * Each non-helper non-static non-finalizer method declared in a type
     T, must preserve the static invariant of T, if T is finished with
     its static initialization, and must preserve the instance
     invariant of the receiver object.

   * Each non-helper static method declared in a type T, must preserve
     the static invariant of T, if T is finished with its static
     initialization.
   When doing such proofs, one may assume the static invariant of any
type (that is finished with its static initialization), and one may
also assume the instance invariant of any other object.

   In this, more modular, style of checking invariants, one can think of
all the static invariants in a class as being implicitly conjoined to
the pre- and postconditions of all non-helper constructors and methods,
and the instance invariants in a class as being implicitly conjoined to
the postcondition of all non-helper constructors, and to the pre- and
postconditions of all non-helper methods.

   As noted above, `helper' methods and constructors are exempt from
the normal rules for checking invariants.  That is because the
beginning and end of invocations of these `helper' methods and
constructors are not visible states, and therefore they do not have to
preserve or establish invariants.  Note that only `private' methods and
constructors can be declared as `helper'.  *Note Helper Methods and
Constructors::.

   The following subsections discuss other points about the semantics of
invariants:
   * Invariants can be declared `static'; see *Note Static vs. instance
     invariants::.

   * Invariants can be declared with the access modifiers `public',
     `protected', and `private', or be left with default access; see
     *Note Access Modifiers for Invariants::.

   * Invariants should also hold in case a constructor or method
     terminates abruptly, by throwing an exception; see *Note
     Invariants and Exceptions::.

   * A class inherits all visible invariants specified in its
     superclasses and superinterfaces; see *Note Invariants and
     Inheritance::.

   * Although some aspects of invariants are discussed in isolation
     here, the full explanation of their semantics can only be given
     considered together with that of method specifications.  After
     all, a method only has to preserve invariants when one of the
     preconditions (i.e., `requires' clauses) specified for that method
     holds.  So invariants are an integral part of the explanation of
     method specifications in *Note Method Specifications::.

   * When considering an individual method body, remember that
     invariants should not just hold in the beginning and the end of
     it, but also at any program point halfway where another
     (non-`helper') method or constructor is invoked.  After all, these
     program points are also visible states, and, as stated above,
     invariants should hold at all visible states.

   * A method invocation on an object should not just preserve the
     instance invariants of that object and the static invariants of
     the class, but it should preserve the invariants of all other
     (reachable) objects as well [Poetzsch-Heffter97].

   It should be noted that the last two points above are not specific to
Java or JML, but these are tricky issues that have to be considered for
any notion of invariant in an object-oriented languages. Indeed, these
two issues make the familiar notion of invariant a lot more complicated
than one might guess at first sight!

8.2.1 Static vs. instance invariants
------------------------------------

As discussed above (*note Invariants::), invariants can be declared
`static' or `instance'.  Just like a static method, a static invariant
cannot refer to the current object `this' and thus cannot refer to
instance fields of `this' or non-static methods of the type.

   Instance invariants must be established by the constructors of an
object, and must be preserved by all non-helper instance methods.  If
an object has fields that can be changed without calling methods
(usually a bad idea), then any such changes must also preserve the
invariants.  For example, if an object has a public field, each
assignment to that field must establish all invariants that might be
affected.

   Static methods do not have a receiver object for which they need to
assume or establish an instance invariant, since they have no receiver
object.  However, a static method may assume instance invariants of
other objects, such as argument objects passed to the method.(1)

   Static invariants must be established by the static initialization
of a class, and must be preserved by all non-helper constructors and
methods, i.e., by both static and instance methods.

   The table below summarizes this:
               | static          non-helper     non-helper    non-helper
               | initialization  static method  constructor   instance method
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     static    | establish       preserve       preserve      preserve
     invariant |
               |
     instance  | (irrelevant)    (irrelevant)   establish     preserve,
     invariant |                                              if not a
                                                              finalizer

   A word of warning about terminology.  As stated above, we call an
invariant about static properties "static invariants" and we call an
invariant about the dynamic properties of objects an "instance
invariant" or, equivalently, an "object invariant."  This terminology
is contrary to the literature but it is more accurate with respect to
the nomenclature of Java.

8.2.2 Invariants and Exceptions
-------------------------------

Methods and constructors should preserve and establish invariants both
in the case of normal termination and in the case of abrupt termination
(i.e., when an exception is thrown).  In other words, invariants are
implicitly included in both normal postconditions, i.e., `ensures'
clauses, and in exceptional postconditions, i.e., `signals' clauses, of
methods and constructors.

   The requirement that invariants hold after abrupt termination of a
method or constructor may seen excessively strong.  However, it is the
only sound option in the long run.  After all, once an object's
invariant is broken, no guarantees whatsoever can be made about
subsequent method invocations on that object.  When faced with a method
or constructor that may violate an invariant in case it throws an
exception, one will typically try to strengthen the precondition of the
method to rule out this exceptional behavior or try to weaken the
invariant.  Note that a method that does not have any side effects when
it throws an exception automatically preserves all invariants.

8.2.3 Access Modifiers for Invariants
-------------------------------------

Invariants can be declared with any one of the Java access modifiers
`private', `protected', and `public'.  Like class members, invariants
declared in a class have `package' visibility if they do not have one
of these keywords as modifier.  Similarly, invariants declared in an
interface implicitly have `public' visibility if they do not have one
of these keywords as modifier.

   The access modifier of an invariant affects which members, i.e. which
fields and which (pure) methods, may be used in it, according to JML's
usual visibility rules.  *Note Privacy Modifiers and Visibility::, for
the details and an example using invariants.

   The access modifiers of invariants do _not_ affect the obligations
of methods and constructors to maintain and establish them.  That is,
_all_ non-`helper' methods are expected to preserve invariants
irrespective of the access modifiers of the invariants and the methods.
For example, a public method must preserve private invariants as well
as public ones.

   [[[ JML's visibility restrictions still allow some highly dubious
invariants.  E.g., a private invariant can refer to a public field,
which, if this public field is not final, means the invariant is not
really enforceable.  Tools should warn about (or forbid??)  invariants
which refer to non-final non-model fields that have a looser access
control than the invariant itself has.  ]]]

8.2.4 Invariants and Inheritance
--------------------------------

Each type inherits all the instance invariants specified in its
superclasses and superinterfaces.  [[[Erik wrote: "Static invariants
are not inherited", but there seems to be some kind of static field
inheritance in Java...]]]  [[[ DRCok- but all the static invariants of
a superclass have to be maintained by the subclass methods - isn't this
equivalent to inheritance?]]]

   The fact that (instance) invariants are inherited is one of the
reasons why the use of the keyword `super' is not allowed in
invariants.  [[[ Is this true? - I don't understand this. DRCok ]]]

8.3 Constraints
===============

History constraints [Liskov-Wing93b] [Liskov-Wing94], which we call
"constraints" for short, are related to invariants.  But whereas
invariants are predicates that should hold in all visible states,
history constraints are relationships that should hold for the
combination of each visible state and any visible state that occurs
later in the program's execution.  Constraints can therefore be used to
constrain the way that values change over time.

   The syntax of history constraints in JML is as follows.

     HISTORY-CONSTRAINT ::= CONSTRAINT-KEYWORD PREDICATE
                   [ `for' CONSTRAINED-LIST ] `;'
     CONSTRAINT-KEYWORD ::= `constraint' | `constraint_redundantly'
     CONSTRAINED-LIST ::= METHOD-NAME-LIST | `\everything'
     METHOD-NAME-LIST ::= METHOD-NAME [ `,' METHOD-NAME ] ...
     METHOD-NAME ::= METHOD-REF [ `(' [ PARAM-DISAMBIG-LIST ] `)' ] | METHOD-REF-START `.' `*'
     METHOD-REF ::= METHOD-REF-START [ `.' METHOD-REF-REST ] ...
             | `new' REFERENCE-TYPE
     METHOD-REF-START ::=  `super' | `this' | IDENT
     METHOD-REF-REST ::=  `this' | IDENT
     PARAM-DISAMBIG-LIST ::= PARAM-DISAMBIG [ `,' PARAM-DISAMBIG ] ...
     PARAM-DISAMBIG ::= TYPE-SPEC [ IDENT [ DIMS ] ]

   Because methods will not necessarily change the values referred to in
a constraint, a constraint will generally describe reflexive and
transitive relations.

   For example, the constraints in the example below say that the value
of field `a' and the length of the array `b' will never change, and
that the length of the array `c' will only ever increase.  
     package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

     public abstract class Constraint {

         int a;
         //@ constraint a == \old(a);

         boolean[] b;

         //@ invariant b != null;
         //@ constraint b.length == \old(b.length) ;

         boolean[] c;

         //@ invariant c != null;
         //@ constraint c.length >= \old(c.length) ;

         //@ requires bLength >= 0 && cLength >= 0;
         Constraint(int bLength, int cLength) {
           b = new boolean[bLength];
           c = new boolean[cLength];
         }
     }
   Note that, unlike invariants, constraints can - and typically do -
use the JML keyword `\old'.

   A constraint declaration may optionally explicitly list one or more
methods.  It is the listed methods that must "respect" the constraint.
If no methods are listed, then all non-helper methods of the class (and
any subclasses) must respect the constraint.  A method respects a
history constraint iff the pre-state and the post-state of a non-static
method invocation are in the relation specified by the history
constraint.  So one can think of history constraints as being
implicitly included in the postcondition of relevant methods.  However,
history constraints do not apply to constructors and destructors, since
constructors do not have a pre-state and destructors do not have a
post-state.

   Private methods declared as `helper' methods do not have to respect
history constraints, just like these do not have to preserve invariants.

   A few points to note about history constraints:
   * Constraints can be declared `static'; see *Note Static vs.
     instance constraints::.

   * Constraints can be declared with the access modifiers `public',
     `protected', and `private'; see *Note Access Modifiers for
     Constraints::.

   * Constraints should also hold if a method terminates abruptly by
     throwing an exception.

   * A class inherits all constraints specified in its superclasses and
     superinterfaces; see *Note Constraints and Inheritance::.

   * Although some aspects of constraints are discussed in isolation
     here, the full explanation of their semantics can only be given
     considered together with that of method specifications.  After
     all, a method only has to respect constraints when one of the
     preconditions (ie. `requires' clauses) specified for that method
     holds.  So constraints are an integral part of the explanation of
     method specifications in *Note Method Specifications::.

   * When considering an individual method body, remember that
     constraints not only have to hold between the pre-state and the
     post-state, but between all visible state that arise during
     execution of the method.  So, given that any program points in the
     method where (non-`helper') methods or constructors are invoked
     are also visible states, constraints should also hold between the
     pre-state and any such program points, between these program
     points themselves, and between any such program points and the
     post-state.

   * A method invocation on an object `o' should not just respect the
     constraints of `o', but should respect the constraints of all
     other (reachable) objects as well.

   These aspects of constraints are discussed in more detail below.

8.3.1 Static vs. instance constraints
-------------------------------------

History constraints can be declared `static'.  Non-`static' constraints
are also called _instance_ constraints.  Like a static invariant, a
static history constraint cannot refer to the current object `this' or
to its fields.

   Static constraints should be respected by all constructors and all
methods, i.e., both static and instance methods.

   Instance constraints must be respected by all instance methods.

   The table below summarizes this:
               | static          non-helper     non-helper    non-helper
               | initialization  static method  constructor   instance method
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     static    | (irrelevant)    respect        respect       respect
     constraint|
               |
     instance  | (irrelevant)    (irrelevant)   (irrelevant)  respect
     constraint|

   Instance constraints are irrelevant for constructors, in that here
there is no pre-state for a constructor that can be related (or not) to
the post-state.  However, if a visible state arises during the
execution of a constructor, then any instance constraints have to be
respected.

   In the same way, and for the same reason, static constraints are
irrelevant for static initialization.

8.3.2 Access Modifiers for Constraints
--------------------------------------

The access modifiers `public', `private', and `protected' pose exactly
the same restrictions on constraints as they do on invariants, see
*Note Access Modifiers for Invariants::.

8.3.3 Constraints and Inheritance
---------------------------------

Any class inherits all the instance constraints specified in its
superclasses and superinterfaces.  [[[Static constraints are not
inherited.]]] [[[ But they still apply to subclasses, no ? and it says
they are above - David]]]

   The fact that (instance) constraints are inherited is one of the
reasons why the use of the keyword `super' is not allowed in
constraints.  [[[ Needs explanation - David ]]]


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Represents Clauses,  Next: Initially Clauses,  Prev: Constraints,  Up: Type Specifications

8.4 Represents Clauses
======================

The following is the syntax for `represents' clauses.

     REPRESENTS-CLAUSE ::= REPRESENTS-KEYWORD STORE-REF-EXPRESSION
                         L-ARROW-OR-EQ SPEC-EXPRESSION `;'
             | REPRESENTS-KEYWORD STORE-REF-EXPRESSION `\such_that'
               PREDICATE `;'
     REPRESENTS-KEYWORD ::= `represents' | `represents_redundantly'
     L-ARROW-OR-EQ ::= `<-' | `='

   The first form of `represents' clauses (with `<-' or `=') is called
a "functional abstraction".  This form defines the value of the
STORE-REF-EXPRESSION in a visible state as the value of the
SPEC-EXPRESSION that follows the L-ARROW-OR-EQ.

   The second form (with `\such_that') is called a "relational
abstraction".  This form constrains the value of the
STORE-REF-EXPRESSION in a visible state to satisfy the given PREDICATE.

   * The left-hand side of a `represents' clause must be a reference to
     a model field (*Note Class and Interface Member Declarations::,
     for details of model fields).  Although it is a
     STORE-REF-EXPRESSION, wild cards and array ranges are not
     permitted.

   * In the functional abstraction form, the type of right-hand side of
     a `represents clause' must be assignment-compatible to the type of
     left-hand side.

   * In the relational abstraction form, the type of right-hand side of
     a `represents clause' must be `boolean'.

   A `represents' clause can be declared as `static' (*Note Type
Definitions::, for `static' declarations).  In a `static represents'
clause, only static elements can be referenced both in the left-hand
side and the right-hand side.  In addition, the following restriction
is enforced:

   * A `static' `represents' clause must be declared in the type where
     the model field on the left-hand side is declared.

   Unless explicitly declared as `static', a `represents' clause is
non-`static' (for exceptions see *note Type Definitions::).  A
non-`static represents' clause can refer to both `static' and
non-`static' elements on the right-hand side.

   * A non-`static represents' clause must not have a static model
     field in its left-hand side.

   * A non-`static represents' clause must be declared in a type
     descended from (or nested within) the type where the model field on
     the left-hand side is declared.

   Note that represents clauses can be recursive.  That is, a represents
clause may name a field on its right hand side that is the same as the
field being represented (named on the left hand side).  It is the
specifier's responsibility to make sure such definitions are
well-defined.  But such recursive represents clauses can be useful when
dealing with recursive datatypes [Mueller-Poetzsch-Heffter-Leavens03].

8.5 Initially Clauses
=====================

The INITIALLY-CLAUSE has the following syntax.

     INITIALLY-CLAUSE ::= `initially' PREDICATE `;'

   The meaning is that each non-helper (*note Helper::) constructor for
each concrete subtype of the enclosing type (including that type
itself, if it is concrete) must establish the PREDICATE.  Thus, the
predicate can be thought of as implicitly conjoined to the
postconditions of all non-helper constructors.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Axioms,  Next: Readable If Clauses,  Prev: Initially Clauses,  Up: Type Specifications

8.6 Axioms
==========

An AXIOM-CLAUSE has the following syntax.

     AXIOM-CLAUSE ::= `axiom' PREDICATE `;'

   Such a clause specifies that a theorem prover should assume that the
given predicate is true (whenever such an assumption is needed).

   [[[ example needed ]]]


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Readable If Clauses,  Next: Writable If Clauses,  Prev: Axioms,  Up: Type Specifications

8.7 Readable If Clauses
=======================

The syntax of the READABLE-IF-CLAUSE is as follows.

     READABLE-IF-CLAUSE ::= `readable' IDENT `if' PREDICATE `;'

   Such a clause gives a condition that must be true before the field
named by IDENT can be read.  This field must be one declared in the
type in which the declaration appears, or in a supertype of the class.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Writable If Clauses,  Next: Monitors For Clause,  Prev: Readable If Clauses,  Up: Type Specifications

8.8 Writable If Clauses
=======================

The syntax of the WRITEABLE-IF-CLAUSE is as follows.

     WRITABLE-IF-CLAUSE ::= `writable' IDENT `if' PREDICATE `;'

   Such a clause gives a condition that must be true before the field
named by IDENT can be written.  This field must be one declared in the
type in which the declaration appears, or in a supertype of the class.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Monitors For Clause,  Prev: Writable If Clauses,  Up: Type Specifications

8.9 Monitors For Clause
=======================

The MONITORS-FOR-CLAUSE is adapted from ESC/Java [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00]
[Rodriguez-etal05].  It has the following syntax.

     MONITORS-FOR-CLAUSE ::= `monitors_for' IDENT
                             L-ARROW-OR-EQ SPEC-EXPRESSION-LIST `;'

   A MONITORS-FOR-CLAUSE such as `monitors_for f <- e1, e2;' specifies
a relationship between the field, `f' and a set of objects, denoted by
a specification expression list `e1, e2'.  The meaning of this
declaration is that all of the (non-null) objects in the list, in this
example, the objects denoted by `e1' and `e2', must be locked to read
the field (`f' in the example) in this object.

   Note that the righthand-side of the MONITORS-FOR-CLAUSE is not just a
STORE-REF-LIST, but is in fact a SPEC-EXPRESSION-LIST, where each
SPEC-EXPRESSION evaluates to a reference to an object.

9 Method Specifications
***********************

Although the use of pre- and postconditions for specification of the
behavior of methods is standard, JML offers some features that are not
so standard.  A good example of such a feature is the distinction
between normal and exceptional postconditions (in `ensures' and
`signals' clauses, respectively), and the specification of frame
conditions using `assignable' clauses.  Another example of such a
feature is that JML uses privacy modifiers to allow one to write
different specification that are intended for different readers; for
example, one can write a public specification for clients, a protected
specification for subclasses, and a private specification to record
implementation design decisions.  Yet another such feature is the use
of redundancy to allow one to point out important consequences of a
specification for readers [Tan95] [Leavens-Baker99].

   JML provides two constructs for specifying methods and constructors:
   * pre- and postconditions, and

   * model programs.


   This chapter only discusses the first of these, which is by far the
most common.  Model programs are discussed in *Note Model Programs::.

==========================================

[[[Discuss the "client viewpoint" here and give some basic examples
here.]]]

   [[[Perhaps discuss other common things to avoid repeating ourselves
below...]]]


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Organization of Method Specifications,  Next: Access Control in Specification Cases,  Prev: Basic Concepts in Method Specification,  Up: Method Specifications

9.2 Organization of Method Specifications
=========================================

The following gives the syntax of behavioral specifications for methods.
We start with the top-level syntax that organizes these specifications.

     METHOD-SPECIFICATION ::= SPECIFICATION | EXTENDING-SPECIFICATION
     EXTENDING-SPECIFICATION ::= `also' SPECIFICATION
     SPECIFICATION ::= SPEC-CASE-SEQ [ REDUNDANT-SPEC ]
                   | REDUNDANT-SPEC
     SPEC-CASE-SEQ ::= SPEC-CASE [ `also' SPEC-CASE ] ...

   Redundant specifications (REDUNDANT-SPEC) are discussed in *Note
Redundancy::.

   A METHOD-SPECIFICATION of a method in a class or interface _must_
start with the keyword `also' if (and only if) this method is already
declared in the parent type that the current type extends, in one of
the interfaces the class implements, or in a previous file of the
refinement sequence for this type.  Starting a METHOD-SPECIFICATION
with the keyword `also' is intended to tell the reader that this
specification is in addition to some specifications of the method that
are given in the superclass of the class, one of the interfaces it
implements, or in another file in the refinement sequence.

   A METHOD-SPECIFICATION can include any number of SPEC-CASEs, joined
by the keyword `also', as well as a REDUNDANT-SPEC.  Aside from the
REDUNDANT-SPEC, each of the SPEC-CASEs specifies a behavior that must
be satisfied by a correct implementation of the method or constructor.
That is, whenever a call to the specified method or constructor
satisfies the precondition of one of its SPEC-CASEs, the rest of the
clauses in that SPEC-CASE must also be satisfied by the implementation
[Dhara-Leavens96] [Leavens-Naumann06] [Leavens06b] [Raghavan-Leavens05]
[Wills92b] [Wing83].  Model program specification cases, which have no
explicit preconditions, must be satisified by all implementations.

   The SPEC-CASEs in a METHOD-SPECIFICATION can have several forms:

     SPEC-CASE ::= LIGHTWEIGHT-SPEC-CASE | HEAVYWEIGHT-SPEC-CASE
             | MODEL-PROGRAM

   Model programs are discussed in *Note Model Programs::.  The
remainder of this chapter concentrates on lightweight and heavyweight
behavior specification cases.  JML distinguishes between
   * _heavyweight specification cases_, which start with one of the
     keywords `behavior', `normal_behavior' or `exceptional_behavior',
     or one of their British variant spellings keywords `behaviour',
     `normal_behaviour' or `exceptional_behaviour' (these are also
     called behavior, normal behavior, and exceptional behavior
     specification cases, respectively), and

   * _lightweight specification cases_, which do not contain one of
     these behavior keywords.

   A lightweight specification case is similar to a behavior
specification case, but with different defaults [Leavens-Baker-Ruby06].
It also is possible to desugar all such specification cases into
behavior specification cases [Raghavan-Leavens05].


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Access Control in Specification Cases,  Next: Lightweight Specification Cases,  Prev: Organization of Method Specifications,  Up: Method Specifications

9.3 Access Control in Specification Cases
=========================================

Heavyweight specification cases may be declared with an explicit access
modifier, according to the following syntax.

     PRIVACY ::= `public' | `protected' | `private'

   The access modifier of a heavyweight specification case cannot allow
more access than the method being specified.  So a `public' method may
have a `private' behavior specification, but a `private' method may not
have a `public' public specification.  A heavyweight specification case
without an explicit access modifier is considered to have default
(package) access.

   Lightweight specification cases have no way to explicitly specify an
access modifier, so their access modifier is implicitly the same as the
method being specified.  For example, a lightweight specification of a
`public' method has `public' access, implicitly, but a lightweight
specification of a `private' method has `private' access, implicitly.
Note that this is a different default than that for heavyweight
specifications, where an omitted access modifier always means package
access.

   The access modifier of a specification case affects only which
annotations are visible in the specification and does _not_ affect the
semantics of a specification case in any other way.

   JML's usual visibility rules apply to specification cases.  So, for
example, a public specification case may only refer to public members,
a protected specification case may refer to both public and protected
members, as long as the protected members are otherwise accessible
according to Java's rules, etc.  *Note Privacy Modifiers and
Visibility::, for more details and examples.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Lightweight Specification Cases,  Next: Heavyweight Specification Cases,  Prev: Access Control in Specification Cases,  Up: Method Specifications

9.4 Lightweight Specification Cases
===================================

Syntax
------

The following is the syntax of lightweight specification cases.  These
are the most concise specification cases.

     LIGHTWEIGHT-SPEC-CASE ::= GENERIC-SPEC-CASE
     GENERIC-SPEC-CASE ::= [ SPEC-VAR-DECLS ]
                           SPEC-HEADER
                           [ GENERIC-SPEC-BODY ]
             | [ SPEC-VAR-DECLS ]
               GENERIC-SPEC-BODY
     GENERIC-SPEC-BODY ::= SIMPLE-SPEC-BODY
             | `{|' GENERIC-SPEC-CASE-SEQ `|}'
     GENERIC-SPEC-CASE-SEQ ::= GENERIC-SPEC-CASE
                               [ `also' GENERIC-SPEC-CASE ] ...
     SPEC-HEADER ::= REQUIRES-CLAUSE [ REQUIRES-CLAUSE ] ...
     SIMPLE-SPEC-BODY ::= SIMPLE-SPEC-BODY-CLAUSE
                          [ SIMPLE-SPEC-BODY-CLAUSE ] ...
     SIMPLE-SPEC-BODY-CLAUSE ::= DIVERGES-CLAUSE
             | ASSIGNABLE-CLAUSE | CAPTURES-CLAUSE
             | WHEN-CLAUSE | WORKING-SPACE-CLAUSE
             | DURATION-CLAUSE | ENSURES-CLAUSE
             | SIGNALS-ONLY-CLAUSE | SIGNALS-CLAUSE
   [[[ Is this list missing measured_by, accessible, callable? - DRC ]]]

   As far as the syntax is concerned, the only difference between a
lightweight specification case and a BEHAVIOR-SPECIFICATION-CASE (*note
Behavior Specification Cases::) is that the latter has the keyword
`behavior' and possibly an access control modifier.

   A lightweight specification case always has the same access modifier
as the method being specified, see *Note Access Control in
Specification Cases::.  To specify a different access control modifier,
one must use a heavyweight specification.

Semantics
---------

A lightweight specification case can be understood as syntactic sugar
for a behavior specification case, except that the defaults for omitted
specification clauses are different for lightweight specification cases
than for behavior specification cases.  So, for example, apart from the
class names, method `m' in class `Lightweight' below 
     package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

     public abstract class Lightweight {

         protected boolean P, Q, R;
         protected int X;

         /*@ requires P;
           @  assignable X;
           @  ensures Q;
           @  signals (Exception) R;
           @*/
         protected abstract int m() throws Exception;
     }
   has a specification that is equivalent to that of method `m' in
class `Heavyweight' below.  
     package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

     public abstract class Heavyweight {

         protected boolean P, Q, R;
         protected int X;

         /*@ protected behavior
           @   requires P;
           @   diverges false;
           @   assignable X;
           @   when \not_specified;
           @   working_space \not_specified;
           @   duration \not_specified;
           @   ensures Q;
           @   signals_only Exception;
           @   signals (Exception) R;
           @*/
         protected abstract int m() throws Exception;
     }

   As this example illustrates, the default for an omitted clause in a
lightweight specification is `\not_specified' for all clauses, except
`diverges', which has a default of `false', and `signals'
[Leavens-Baker-Ruby06].  The default for an omitted `signals' clause is
to only permit the exceptions declared in the method's header to be
thrown.  Thus, if the method declares that exceptions `DE1' and `DE2'
may be thrown, then the default for an omitted `signals' clause is
       signals (Exception e) e instanceof DE1 || e instanceof DE2;
   It is intended that the meaning of `\not_specified' may vary between
different uses of a JML specification.  For example, a static checker
might treat a `requires' clause that is `\not_specified' as if it were
`true', while a verification logic may decide to treat it as if it were
`false'.

   A completely omitted specification is taken to be a lightweight
specification.  If the default (zero-argument) constructor of a class
is omitted because its code is omitted,  then its specification
defaults to an assignable clause that allows all the locations that the
default (zero-argument) constructor of its superclass assigns -- in
essence a copy of the superclass's default constructor's assignable
clause.  If some other frame is desired, then one has to write the
specification, or at least the code, explicitly.

   A method or constructor with code present has a "completely omitted"
specification if it has no SPECIFICATION-CASEs and does not use
annotations like `non_null' or `pure' that add implicit specifications.

   If a method or constructor has code, has a completely omitted
specification, and does not override another method, then its meaning
is taken as the lightweight specification `diverges \not_specified;'.
Thus, its meaning can be read from the lightweight column of table
above, except that the diverges clause is not given its usual default.
This is done so that the default specification when no specification is
given truly says nothing about the method's behavior.  However, if a
method with code and a completely omitted specification overrides some
other method, then its meaning is taken to be the lightweight
specification `also requires false;'.  This somewhat counter-intuitive
specification is the unit under specification conjunction with `also';
it is used so as not to change the meaning of the inherited
specification.

   If the code is annotated with keywords like `non_null' or `pure'
that add implicit specifications, then these implicit specifications
are used instead of the default.  Code with such annotations is
considered to have an implicit specification.

9.5 Heavyweight Specification Cases
===================================

There are three kinds of heavyweight specification cases, called
behavior, normal behavior, and exceptional behavior specification
cases, beginning (after an optional privacy modifier) with the one of
the keywords `behavior', `normal_behavior', or `exceptional_behavior',
respectively.

     HEAVYWEIGHT-SPEC-CASE ::= BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASE
             | EXCEPTIONAL-BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASE
             | NORMAL-BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASE

   Like lightweight specification cases, normal behavior and exceptional
behavior specification cases can be understood as syntactic sugar for
special kinds of `behavior' specification cases [Raghavan-Leavens05].


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Behavior Specification Cases,  Next: Normal Behavior Specification Cases,  Prev: Heavyweight Specification Cases,  Up: Method Specifications

9.6 Behavior Specification Cases
================================

The behavior specification case is the most general form of
specification case.  All other forms of specification cases simply
provide some syntactic sugar for special kinds of `behavior'
specification cases.

Syntax
------

As far as the syntax is concerned, the only difference between a
`behavior' specification case and a lightweight one is the optional
access control modifier, PRIVACY, and the keyword `behavior' (or the
British variant, `behaviour').  One can use either the British or the
American spelling of this keyword, although for historical reasons most
examples will use the American spelling.

     BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASE ::= [ PRIVACY ] [ `code' ] BEHAVIOR-KEYWORD
                            GENERIC-SPEC-CASE
     BEHAVIOR-KEYWORD ::= `behavior' | `behaviour'

   *Note Code Contracts::, for details of the semantics of
BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASEs that use the `code' keyword.

Semantics
---------

To explain the semantics of a behavior specification case we make a
distinction between flat and nested specification cases:
   * "Flat" specification cases are of the form
           `behavior' [ SPEC-VAR-DECLS ] [ SPEC-HEADER ] SIMPLE-SPEC-BODY
     A flat specification case is just made up of a sequence of method
     specification clauses, ie. `require', `ensures', etc. clauses, and
     its semantics is explained directly in *Note Semantics of flat
     behavior specification cases::.

   * "Nested" specification cases are all other specification cases.
     They use the special brackets `{|' and `|}' to nest specification
     clauses and possibly also `also' inside these brackets to join
     several specification cases.

     A nested specification case can be syntactically desugared into a
     list of one or more simple specification cases, joined by the
     `also' keyword [Raghavan-Leavens05].  This is explained in *Note
     Semantics of nested behavior specification cases::.

Invariants and constraints
--------------------------

The semantics of a behavior specification case for a method or
constructor in a class depends on the invariants and constraints that
have been specified.  This is discussed in *Note Invariants:: and *Note
Constraints::.  In a nutshell, methods must preserve invariants and
respect constraints, and constructors must establish invariants.

9.6.1 Semantics of flat behavior specification cases
----------------------------------------------------

Below we explain the semantics of a simple BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASE case with
precisely one `requires' clause, one `diverges' clause, one
`measured_by' clause, one `assignable' clause, one `accessible' clause,
one `callable' clause, one `when' clause, one `ensures' clause, one
`duration' clause, one `working_space' clause, one `signals_only'
clause, and one `signals' clause.

   A `behavior' specification case can contain any number of these
clauses, and there are defaults that allow any of them to be omitted.
However, as explained in *Note Method Specification Clauses::, any
`behavior' specification case is equivalent with a `behavior'
specification case of this form.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Non-helper methods,  Next: Non-helper constructors,  Prev: Semantics of flat behavior specification cases,  Up: Behavior Specification Cases

9.6.2 Non-helper methods
------------------------

Consider a non-`helper' instance method `m', and a specification case
of the following form.
       behavior
         forall T1 x1; ... forall Tn xn;
         old U1 y1 = F1; ... old Uk yk = Fk;
         requires P;
         measured_by Mbe `if' Mbp;
         diverges D;
         when W;
         accessible R;
         assignable A;
         callable p1(...), ..., pl(...);
         captures Z;
         ensures Q;
         signals_only E1, ..., Eo;
         signals (E e) S;
         working_space Wse `if' Wsp;
         duration De `if' Dp;

   The meaning of this specification case is as follows.

   Consider a particular call of the method m.

   The state of the program after passing parameters to m, but before
running any of the code of m is called the "pre-state" of the method
call.

   Suppose all applicable invariants hold in the pre-state of this call.

   For every possible value of the variables declared in the `forall'
clauses, x1, ..., xn, the following must be true.  (If there are no
`forall' clauses, then the following just has to hold all by itself.)

   Suppose that the variable y1 is bound to the pre-state value of F1
in the pre-state (i.e., the beginning of the method, after parameter
passing), and in turn each of the `old' variable declarations are bound
to the values of the corresponding expressions, also evaluated in the
pre-state, and finally yk is bound to the value of Fk in the pre-state.
These bindings can depend on previously defined `old' variable
declarations in the specification case.  (If there are no `old'
clauses, then no such variables are bound.)  We call the state with
such bindings in place the "augmented pre-state".

   Suppose also that with these binding (i.e., in the augmented
pre-state), that the precondition, P, from the `requires' clause, holds.

   If the method has a `measured_by' clause, and if the predicate in
the `measured_by' clause, Mbp, is true in the augmented pre-state, and
if this call is in the control flow of another instance of this method,
Caller, then the value of the expression Mbe in this call's augmented
pre-state must be non-negative and strictly less than the value of Mbe
in the pre-state of Caller.  (If the `measured_by' clause is omitted,
there is no such requirement.)  For example, consider a method `fib'
that calls itself directly and has an integer parameter `n' and for
which the `measured_by' clause has `n' as its expression (Mbe), and the
default predicate (Mbp) is true; then recursive calls of `fib' that
appear in the body of `fib' must have actual argument exprssions whose
value is (non-negative and) strictly less than `n', such as `n-1' and
`n-2'.(1)

   Then one of the following must also hold:
   * the `diverges' predicate, D, holds in the augmented pre-state and
     the execution of the method does not terminate (i.e., it loops
     forever or the Java virtual machine exits in such a way that the
     method call does not return or throw an exception).  (If the
     `diverges' clause is omitted, then the default for D is `false',
     and hence these outcomes are effectively prohibited.)  or

   * the Java virtual machine throws an error (i.e., an instance of
     `java.lang.Throwable' whose type does not inherit from
     `java.lang.Exception', usually an instance of `java.lang.Error'),
     or

   * the method terminates by returning or throwing an exception,
     reaching a state called its "post-state", in which all of the
     following hold.
        * The method's execution only reaches its commit point (a label
          in the method body with the name "`commit'"
          [Rogriguez-etal05]) in a state such that the `when' clause's
          condition, W, holds.  (If the condition does not hold, then
          the method's execution waits for a concurrent thread to make
          it true, and then proceeds.  There is no guarantee that the
          method will proceed the first time this condition holds, so
          the condition may have to hold many times before the thread
          may proceed to its commit point.)  (If the `when' clause is
          omitted, there is no need to have a commit point in the
          method, and the method need not wait for the execution of
          concurrent threads.)

        * During execution of the method (which includes all directly
          and indirectly called methods and constructors), only
          locations that either did not exist in the pre-state, that
          are local to the method (including the method's formal
          parameters), or that are either named in the lists R and A
          found in the `accessible' and `assignable' clauses or that
          are dependees (*note Data Groups::) of such locations, are
          read from.  The set of locations named by the accessible and
          assignable clauses (and hence the elements of their data
          groups) are computed in the pre-state.  (If the `accessible'
          clause is omitted, it defaults to `accessible \everything;',
          which allows all locations to be accessed.)

        * During execution of the method, only locations that either
          did not exist in the pre-state, that are local to the method,
          or that are either named by the `assignable' clause's list, A,
          or are dependees (*note Data Groups::) of such locations, are
          assigned to.  The set of locations named by the assignable
          clause (and hence the elements of their data groups) are
          computed in the pre-state.  (If the `assignable' clause is
          omitted, it defaults to `assignable \everything;', which
          allows all locations to be assigned.)

        * During execution of the method, the only methods and
          constructors called are those listed in the `callable'
          clause's list p1, ..., pl.  (If the `callable' clause is
          omitted, it defaults to `callable \everything;', which allows
          all methods and constructors to be called.)

          The form p`.*' refers to all methods of the object denoted by
          p.

        * During execution of the method, of the formal parameters
          whose type is a reference type, only those listed in the
          `captures' clause's list, Z, may be assigned to fields of
          some object or to array elements.  (References in formals may
          freely be assigned to local variables, however, as these are
          "borrowed" but not captured [Boyland00].  If the `captures'
          clause is omitted, then all such formals may be assigned
          freely.)

        * If the execution of the method terminates by returning
          normally, then the normal postcondition, Q, given in the
          `ensures' clause, holds in the post-state.

        * If the execution of the method terminates by throwing an
          exception of some type Ea that is a subtype of
          `java.lang.Exception', then:
             * the type Ea must be a subtype of some type in the list
               E1, ..., Eo, listed in the `signals_only' clause (this
               list of types has as its default the list in the
               method's `throws' clause), and

             * if Ea is a subtype of the type E given in the `signals'
               clause, then the exceptional postcondition R must hold
               in the post-state, augmented by a binding from the
               variable e to the exception object thrown.

        * All applicable invariants and history constraints hold in the
          post-state.

        * If the predicate in the `working_space' clause, Wsp, was true
          in the augmented pre-state, then the method execution had
          available to it the amount of heap space, in bytes, Wse
          [Krone-Ogden-Sitaraman03].  (Note that the expression Wse may
          depend on post-state values so this expression is
          conceptually evaluated in the post-state, although it may use
          `\old()' to refer to pre-state values.  If the
          `working_space' clause is omitted, there is no restriction
          placed on the maximum space that the method call may during
          its execution.)

        * If the predicate in the `duration' clause, Dp, was true in
          the augmented pre-state, then the method execution used no
          more than the number of virtual machine cycles given by the
          expression De [Krone-Ogden-Sitaraman03].  (Note that the
          expression De may depend on post-state values so this
          expression is conceptually evaluated in the post-state,
          although it may use `\old()' to refer to pre-state values.
          If the `duration' clause is omitted, there is no restriction
          placed on the maximum number of virtual machine cycles that
          the call may use during its execution.)

   In all of these clauses, the value of a formal parameter is always
considered to be the value they had in the pre-state.  That is the
actual post-state value they take in an execution is not considered, as
explained in *Note Parameters in Postconditions::.

The semantics of a flat specification case for a (non-`helper')
constructor is the same as that for a (non-`helper') method given
above, except that:
   * any instance invariants of the object being initialized by the
     constructor are not assumed to hold in the precondition,

   * any instance constraints do not have to be established as implicit
     part of the postcondition of the constructor.
   These two differences are also discussed in *Note Invariants:: and
*Note Constraints::.

-------------------------------------

The semantics of a flat specification case for a helper method (or
constructor) is the same as that for a non-helper method (or

   * the instance invariants for the current object and the static
     invariants for the current class are not assumed to hold in the
     pre-state, and do not have to be established in the post-state.

   * the instance constraints for current object and the static
     constraints for the current class do not have to be established in
     the post-state

9.6.5 Semantics of nested behavior specification cases
------------------------------------------------------

We now explain how all behavior specification cases can be desugared
into a list of one or more flat specification cases joined by the
`also' keyword [Raghavan-Leavens05].  The semantics of a behavior
specification case is then simply the semantics of this desugared
version.

   The desugaring is as follows.  Consider a specification of the form.

     SPEC-VAR-DECLS
     SPEC-HEADER
     {|
         GENSPECCASE1
       also
         ...
       also
         GENSPECCASEN
     |}

   The above desugars to the following.

         SPEC-VAR-DECLS
         SPEC-HEADER
         GENSPECCASE1
       also
         ...
       also
         SPEC-VAR-DECLS
         SPEC-HEADER
         GENSPECCASEN

   In the above desugaring either the SPEC-VAR-DECLS or the SPEC-HEADER
(or both) may be omitted.

   The meaning of the desugared list of specification cases is
explained in *Note Organization of Method Specifications::.  The
meaning of a single simple specification case is explained in *Note
Semantics of flat behavior specification cases::.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Normal Behavior Specification Cases,  Next: Exceptional Behavior Specification Cases,  Prev: Behavior Specification Cases,  Up: Method Specifications

9.7 Normal Behavior Specification Cases
=======================================

A `normal_behavior' specification case is just syntactic sugar for a
`behavior' specification case with an implicit `signals' clause
         signals (java.lang.Exception) false;
   ruling out abrupt termination, i.e., the throwing of any exception.
Note that this includes unchecked exceptions, since in Java,
`RuntimeException' is a subclass of `Exception'.

   The following gives the syntax of the body of a normal behavior
specification case.

     NORMAL-BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASE ::= [ PRIVACY ] [ `code' ] NORMAL-BEHAVIOR-KEYWORD
                                   NORMAL-SPEC-CASE
     NORMAL-BEHAVIOR-KEYWORD ::= `normal_behavior' | `normal_behaviour'
     NORMAL-SPEC-CASE ::= GENERIC-SPEC-CASE

   As far as syntax is concerned, the only difference between a
NORMAL-SPEC-CASE and a GENERIC-SPEC-CASE is that normal behavior
specification cases cannot include SIGNALS-CLAUSEs or
SIGNALS-ONLY-CLAUSEs.

   The semantics of a normal behavior specification case is the same as
the corresponding `behavior' specification case (*note Behavior
Specification Cases::) with the addition of the following SIGNALS-CLAUSE

         signals (java.lang.Exception) false;

   So a normal behavior specification case specifies a precondition
which guarantees normal termination; i.e., it prohibits the method from
throwing an exception.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Exceptional Behavior Specification Cases,  Next: Method Specification Clauses,  Prev: Normal Behavior Specification Cases,  Up: Method Specifications

9.8 Exceptional Behavior Specification Cases
============================================

The following gives the syntax of the body of an exceptional behavior
specification case.

     EXCEPTIONAL-BEHAVIOR-SPEC-CASE ::= [ PRIVACY ] [ `code' ] `exceptional-behavior-keyword'
                                        EXCEPTIONAL-SPEC-CASE
     EXCEPTIONAL-BEHAVIOR-KEYWORD ::= `exceptional_behavior' | `exceptional_behaviour'
     EXCEPTIONAL-SPEC-CASE ::= GENERIC-SPEC-CASE

   As far as syntax is concerned, the only difference between an
EXCEPTIONAL-SPEC-CASE and a GENERIC-SPEC-CASE is that exceptional
behavior specification cases cannot include ENSURES-CLAUSEs.

   The semantics of an exceptional behavior specification case is the
same as the corresponding behavior specification case (*note Behavior
Specification Cases::) with the addition of the following `ensures'
clause.

         ensures false;

   So an exceptional behavior specification case specifies a
precondition which guarantees that the method throws an exception, if
it terminates, i.e., a precondition which prohibits the method from
terminating normally.

* Pragmatics of Exceptional Behavior Specification Cases::


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Pragmatics of Exceptional Behavior Specification Cases,  Prev: Exceptional Behavior Specification Cases,  Up: Exceptional Behavior Specification Cases

9.8.1 Pragmatics of Exceptional Behavior Specifications Cases
-------------------------------------------------------------

Note that an exceptional behavior specification case says that some
exception _must_ be thrown if its precondition is met (assuming the
diverges clause predicate is `false', as is the default.)  Beware of
the difference between specifying that an exception _must_ be thrown
and specifying that an exception _may_ be thrown. To specify that an
exception _may_ be thrown you should _not_ use an exceptional behavior,
but should instead use a behavior specification case
[Leavens-Baker-Ruby06].

   For example, the following method specification 
     package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

     public abstract class InconsistentMethodSpec {

         /** A specification that can't be satisfied. */
         /*@  public normal_behavior
          @    requires z <= 99;
          @    assignable \nothing;
          @    ensures \result > z;
          @ also
          @  public exceptional_behavior
          @    requires z < 0;
          @    assignable \nothing;
          @    signals (IllegalArgumentException) true;
          @*/
         public abstract int cantBeSatisfied(int z)
             throws IllegalArgumentException;
     }
   is _inconsistent_ because the preconditions `z <= 99' and `z < 0'
overlap, for example when `z' is `-1'.  When both preconditions hold
then the exceptional behavior case specifies that an exception _must_
be thrown and the normal behavior case specifies that an exception
_must not_ be thrown, but the implementation cannot both throw and not
throw an exception.

   Similarly, multiple exceptional specification cases with overlapping
preconditions may give rise to an inconsistent specification.  For
example, the following method specification 
     package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

     public abstract class InconsistentMethodSpec2 {

         /** A specification that can't be satisfied. */
         /*@  public exceptional_behavior
          @     requires z < 99;
          @     assignable \nothing;
          @     signals_only IllegalArgumentException;
          @ also
          @   public exceptional_behavior
          @     requires z > 0;
          @     assignable \nothing;
          @     signals_only NullPointerException;
          @*/
         public abstract int cantBeSatisfied(int z)
             throws IllegalArgumentException, NullPointerException;
     }
   is inconsistent because, again, the two preconditions overlap, and
the `signals_only' clauses do not permit the same exception to be
thrown in both cases.

   There is an important distinction to be made between the `signals'
and the `signals_only' clauses in JML.  The `signals_only' clause says
what exceptions may be thrown (when the specification case's
precondition is met); this clause does not say anything about the state
of the exception object or other locations in the system.  On the other
hand, the `signals' clause only describes what must be true of the
system state when an exception is thrown, and does not say anything
about what exceptions may be thrown.  For example, consider the
following specification.  
     package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

     public abstract class SignalsClause {

         /*@ signals (IllegalArgumentException) x < 0;
           @ signals (NullPointerException) x < 0;
           @*/
         public abstract int notPrecise(int x) throws RuntimeException;
     }
   The above allows a method to throw either an
`IllegalArgumentException' or a `NullPointerException' when `x' is less
than 0, but in that condition the method might also throw a different
exception altogether, as long as that exception was permitted by the
method's declaration header.  The only thing ruled out by this
specification is throwing either a `IllegalArgumentException' or a
`NullPointerException' when `x' is not less than 0.  Thus from such a
specification one may draw the conclusion that `x < 0' only when one of
these two exceptions is thrown.

   Therefore, if one just wants to specify the exceptions that are
permitted to be thrown in a specific situation, one should use the
`signals_only' clause.

9.9.1 Specification Variable Declarations
-----------------------------------------

The syntax of SPEC-VAR-DECLS is as follows.

     SPEC-VAR-DECLS ::= FORALL-VAR-DECLS [ OLD-VAR-DECLS ]
             | OLD-VAR-DECLS
   The scope of the variables declared in the SPEC-VAR-DECLS is the
entire specification case in which they appear.  The two types of such
declarations are described below.

* Menu:

* Forall Variable Declarations::
* Old Variable Declarations::


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Forall Variable Declarations,  Next: Old Variable Declarations,  Prev: Specification Variable Declarations,  Up: Specification Variable Declarations

9.9.1.1 Forall Variable Declarations
....................................

The syntax of the FORALL-VAR-DECLS is as follows.

     FORALL-VAR-DECLS ::= FORALL-VAR-DECLARATOR [ FORALL-VAR-DECLARATOR ] ...
     FORALL-VAR-DECLARATOR ::= `forall' [ BOUND-VAR-MODIFIERS ] QUANTIFIED-VAR-DECLARATOR `;'

   When a FORALL-VAR-DECLARATOR is used, it specifies that the
specification case that follows must hold for every possible value of
the declared variables.  In other words, it is a universal
quantification over the specification case.

   Note that if such variables are used in preconditions, then they can
be thought to range over all values that satisfy the preconditions.
The bound variable may not rename earlier bound variables in the
specification, nor the formal parameters of the method declaration.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Old Variable Declarations,  Prev: Forall Variable Declarations,  Up: Specification Variable Declarations

9.9.1.2 Old Variable Declarations
.................................

The syntax of the OLD-VAR-DECLS is as follows.  *Note Type-Specs::, for
the syntax of TYPE-SPEC.  [[[Give cross ref for
SPEC-VARIABLE-DECLARATORS when ready.]]]

     OLD-VAR-DECLS ::= OLD-VAR-DECLARATOR [ OLD-VAR-DECLARATOR ] ...
     OLD-VAR-DECLARATOR ::= `old' [ BOUND-VAR-MODIFIERS ] TYPE-SPEC SPEC-VARIABLE-DECLARATORS `;'

   An OLD-VAR-DECLARATOR allows abbreviation within a specification
case.  The names defined in the SPEC-VARIABLE-DECLARATORS can be used
throughout the specification case for the values of their initializers.
As the name suggests, the expressions are evaluated in the method's
pre-state.  The bound variable may not rename earlier bound variables
in the specification, nor the formal parameters of the method
declaration.

   [[[Example]]]


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Requires Clauses,  Next: Ensures Clauses,  Prev: Specification Variable Declarations,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.2 Requires Clauses
----------------------

A requires clause specifies a precondition of method or constructor.
Its syntax is as follows.

     REQUIRES-CLAUSE ::= REQUIRES-KEYWORD PRED-OR-NOT `;'
             | REQUIRES-KEYWORD `\same' `;'
     REQUIRES-KEYWORD ::= `requires' | `pre'
             | `requires_redundantly' | `pre_redundantly'
     PRED-OR-NOT ::= PREDICATE | `\not_specified'

   The PREDICATE in a `requires' clause can refer to any visible fields
and to the parameters of the method.  *Note Privacy Modifiers and
Visibility::, for more details on visibility in JML.

   Any number of requires clauses can be included a single
specification case.  Multiple requires clauses in a specification case
mean the same as a single requires clause whose precondition predicate
is the _conjunction_ of these precondition predicates in the given
requires clauses.  For example,
       requires P;
       requires Q;
   means the same thing as:
       requires P && Q;

   When a requires clause is omitted in a specification case, a default
requires clause is used.  For a lightweight specification case, the
default precondition is `\not_specified'.  The default precondition for
a heavyweight specification case is `true'.

   At most one precondition in a specification case can use `\same',
and `\same' cannot be used in the only specification case for a method
unless the method is an override.  Similarly, `\same' cannot be used in
the only specification case for a constructor or a static method.
Another restriction is that `\same' cannot be used in a requires clause
of a nested specification case (*note Semantics of nested behavior
specification cases::).

   When the precondition is `\same' in a specification case, it means
that the specification case being written has, effectively, the same
precondition as that specified in the other (non-`\same') specification
cases.  That is, `\same' stands for the disjunction of the
preconditions in all non-`\same' specification cases of the method's
specification from the current class together with the inherited
specification cases defined in its supertypes (i.e., in its
superclasses and implemented interfaces).


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Ensures Clauses,  Next: Signals Clauses,  Prev: Requires Clauses,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.3 Ensures Clauses
---------------------

An ensures clause specifies a normal postcondition, i.e., a property
that is guaranteed to hold at the end of the method (or constructor)
invocation in the case that this method (or constructor) invocation
returns without throwing an exception.  The syntax is as follows *Note
Requires Clauses::, for the syntax of PRED-OR-NOT.

     ENSURES-CLAUSE ::= ENSURES-KEYWORD PRED-OR-NOT `;'
     ENSURES-KEYWORD ::= `ensures' | `post'
             | `ensures_redundantly' | `post_redundantly'

   A PREDICATE in an `ensures' clause can refer to any visible fields,
the parameters of the method, `\result' if the method is non-void, and
may contain expressions of the form `\old(E)'.  *Note Privacy Modifiers
and Visibility::, for more details on visibility in JML.

   Informally,
       ensures Q;
   means

     if the method invocation terminates normally (ie. without throwing
     an exception), then predicate Q holds in the post-state.

   In an ensures clause, `\result' stands for the result that is
returned by the method.  The postcondition Q may contain expressions of
the form `\old(e)'.  Such expressions are evaluated in the pre-state,
and not in the post-state, and allow Q to express a relation between
the pre- and the post-state.  If parameters of the method occur in the
postcondition Q, these are always evaluated in the pre-state, not the
post-state.  In other words, if a method parameter x occurs in  Q, it
is treated as `\old('x`)'.  For a detailed explanation of this see
*Note Parameters in Postconditions::.

   Any number of ensures clauses can be given in a single specification
case.  Multiple ensures clauses in a specification case mean the same
as a single ensures clause whose postcondition predicate is the
_conjunction_ of the postcondition predicates in the given ensures
clauses.  So
       ensures P;
       ensures Q;
   means the same as
       ensures P && Q;
   Note that, in JML's semantics for expressions within assertions, the
order of evaluation of P and Q does not matter.  *Note Expression
Evaluation and Undefinedness::, for more details on this topic.

   When an ensures clause is omitted in a specification case, a default
ensures clause is used.  For a lightweight specification case, the
default precondition is `\not_specified'.  The default precondition for
a heavyweight specification case is `true'.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Signals Clauses,  Next: Signals-Only Clauses,  Prev: Ensures Clauses,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.4 Signals Clauses
---------------------

In a specification case a `signals' clause specifies the exceptional or
abnormal postcondition, i.e., the property that is guaranteed to hold
at the end of a method (or constructor) invocation when this method (or
constructor) invocation terminates abruptly by throwing a given
exception.

   The syntax is as follows.  *Note Requires Clauses::, for the syntax
of PRED-OR-NOT.

     SIGNALS-CLAUSE ::= SIGNALS-KEYWORD `(' REFERENCE-TYPE [ IDENT ] `)'
                        [ PRED-OR-NOT ] `;'
     SIGNALS-KEYWORD ::= `signals' | `signals_redundantly'
             | `exsures' | `exsures_redundantly'

   In a SIGNALS-CLAUSE of the form
       signals (E e) P;
   E has to be a subclass of `java.lang.Exception', and the variable e
is bound in P.  If E is a checked exception (i.e., if it does not
inherit from `java.lang.RuntimeException' [Arnold-Gosling-Holmes00]
[Gosling-etal00]), it must either be one of the exceptions listed in
the method or constructor's `throws' clause, or a subclass or a
superclass of such a declared exception.

   Informally,
       signals (E e) P;
   means

     If the method (or constructor) invocation terminates abruptly by
     throwing an exception of type E, then predicate P holds in the
     final state for this exception object E.

   A signals clause of the form
       signals (E e) R;
   is equivalent to the signals clause
       signals (java.lang.Exception e) (e instanceof E) ==> R;

   Several signals clauses can be given in a single lightweight,
behavior or exceptional behavior specification case.  Multiple signals
clauses in a specification case mean the same as a single signals
clause whose exceptional postcondition predicate is the _conjunction_
of the exceptional postcondition predicates in the given signals
clauses.  This should be understood to take place after the desugaring
given above, which makes all the signals clauses refer to exceptions of
type `java.lang.Exception'.  Also, the names in the given signals
clauses have to be standardized [Raghavan-Leavens05].  So for example,
       signals (E1 e) R1;
       signals (E2 e) R2;
   means the same as
       signals (Exception e)   ((e instanceof E1) ==> R1)
                            && ((e instanceof E2) ==> R2);
   Note that this means that if an exception is thrown that is both of
type E1 and of type E2, then both R1 and R2 must hold.

   [[[EXAMPLE]]]

   Beware that a `signals' clause specifies when a certain exception
_may_ be thrown, not when a certain exception _must_ be thrown.  To say
that an exception must be thrown in some situation, one has to exclude
that situation from other signals clauses and from ensures clause (and
any diverges clauses). It may also be useful to use the `signals_only'
clause in such specifications (*note Signals-Only Clauses::).

   [[[EXAMPLE?]]]

   When a behavior or exceptional specification case has no
SIGNALS-CLAUSE, a default signals clause is used.  For a heavyweight
specification case, the default signals clause is `signals (Exception)
true;'.  Since normal behavior specification cases do not have signals
clauses, no default applies for such specification cases.  For a
lightweight specification case, the default is `signals
\not_specified;'.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Signals-Only Clauses,  Next: Parameters in Postconditions,  Prev: Signals Clauses,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.5 Signals-Only Clauses
--------------------------

A `signals_only' clause is an abbreviation for a SIGNALS-CLAUSE (*note
Signals Clauses::) that specifies what exceptions may be thrown by a
method, and thus, implicitly, what exceptions may _not_ be thrown.

   The syntax is as follows.

     SIGNALS-ONLY-CLAUSE ::= SIGNALS-ONLY-KEYWORD REFERENCE-TYPE [ `,' REFERENCE-TYPE ] ... `;'
             | SIGNALS-ONLY-KEYWORD `\nothing' `;'
     SIGNALS-ONLY-KEYWORD ::= `signals_only' | `signals_only_redundantly'

   All of the REFERENCE-TYPEs named in a SIGNALS-ONLY-CLAUSE must be
subtypes of `java.lang.Exception'.  Each REFERENCE-TYPE that is a
checked exception type (i.e., that does not inherit from
`java.lang.RuntimeException' [Arnold-Gosling-Holmes00]
[Gosling-etal00]), must either be one of the exceptions listed in the
method or constructor's `throws' clause, or a subclass or a superclass
of such a declared exception.

   A SIGNALS-ONLY-CLAUSE of the form
       signals_only E1, E2, ..., En;
   is considered to be an abbreviation (syntactic sugar) for the
following SIGNALS clause (*note Signals Clauses::).
       signals (java.lang.Exception e)
                e instanceof E1
             || e instanceof E2
             || ...
             || e instanceof En;
   That is, such a clause specifies that if the method or constructor
throws an exception, it must be an instance of one of the types named.

   Several SIGNALS-ONLY-CLAUSEs can be given in a single lightweight,
behavior or exceptional behavior specification case.  Multiple such
clauses in a specification case mean the same as a single clause whose
list contains only the names Ej that are subtypes of some type named in
all of the given SIGNALS-ONLY-CLAUSEs.  Thus, the meaning is a kind of
intersection of the `signals_only' clauses.  Since this may be
confusing, only one `signals_only' clause should ever be used in a
given specification case.

   The `signals_only' clause is useful for specifying when a certain
exception, or one of a small set of exceptions, _must_ be thrown.  To
say that an exception must be thrown in some situation, one has to
exclude the method from returning normally in that situation (using an
ensures clause or the precondition of some other specification case)
and from not terminating (by using the diverges clause).

   [[[Example]]]

   If the `signals_only' is omitted from a specification case, a
default `signals_only' clause is provided.  The same default is used
for both lightweight and heavyweight behavior and exceptional behavior
specification cases.  (Since normal behavior specification cases cannot
throw exceptions at all, there is no default `signals_only' clause for
such specification cases.)  This default prohibits any exception not
declared by the method in the method's header from being thrown.  Thus
the exact default depends on the method header. If the method header
does not list any exceptions that can be thrown, then the default is
`signals_only \nothing;' (which means that the method cannot throw any
exceptions).  However, if the method header declares that the method
may throw exceptions DE_1, ..., DE_n, Err_1, ..., Err_m, where each
DE_i is a subtype of `java.lang.Exception', and each Err_j is not a
subtype of `java.lang.Exception', then the default `signals_only'
clause is as follows.
        signals_only DE_1, ..., DE_n
   For example, if the method has the header
        public void foo() throws E1, E2
   then the default `signals_only' clause would be
        signals_only E1, E2;

   It is important to note that the set of exceptions included in the
default `signals' clause described above never includes
`java.lang.Throwable', and does not include `java.lang.Error' or any of
its subtypes.  Furthermore, this default would not normally include
`java.lang.RuntimeException' or any of its subtypes, because Java
explicitly allows RuntimeExceptions to be thrown even if they are not
declared in the method header's `throws' clause.  Since such unchecked,
runtime exceptions are not usually listed in the method header, they
would not find their way into the default `signals_only' clause.  In
JML, however, if you wish to allow such runtime exceptions, you can
either explicitly list them in the method header or, more usually, you
would list them in an explicit `signals_only' clause.

9.9.6 Parameters in Postconditions
----------------------------------

Parameters of methods are passed by value in Java, meaning that
parameters are local variables in a method body, which are initialized
when the method is called with the values of the parameters for the
invocation.

   This leads us to the following two rules:

   * The parameters of a method or constructor can never be listed in
     its assignable clause.

   * If parameters of a method (or constructor) are used in a normal or
     exceptional postcondition for that method (or constructor), i.e.,
     in an ensures or signals clause, then these always have their
     value in the pre-state of the method (or constructor), not the
     post-state.  In other words, there is an implicit `\old()' placed
     around any occurrence of a formal parameter in a postcondition.

   The justification for the first convention is that clients cannot
observe assignments to the parameters anyway, as these are local
variables that can only be used by the implementation of the method.
Given that clients can never observe these assignments, there is no
point in making them part of the contract between a class and its
clients.

   The justification for the second convention is that clients only know
the initial values of the parameter that they supply, and do not have
any knowledge of the final values that these variables may have in the
post-state.

   The reason for this is best illustrated by an example.  Consider the
following class and its method specifications.  Without the convention
described above the implementations given for methods `notCorrect1' and
`notCorrect2' would satisfy their specifications.  However, clearly
neither of these satisfies the specification when read from the
caller's point of view.

     package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

     public abstract class ImplicitOld {

         /*@ ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= x;
           @ signals (Exception) x < 0;
           @*/
         public static int notCorrect1(int x) throws Exception {
             x = 5;
             return 4;
         }

         /*@ ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= x;
           @ signals (Exception) x < 0;
           @*/
         public static int notCorrect2(int x) throws Exception {
             x = -1;
             throw new Exception();
         }

         /*@ ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= x;
           @ signals (Exception) x < 0;
           @*/
         public static int correct(int x) throws Exception {
             if (x < 0) {
                 throw new Exception();
             } else {
                 return 0;
             }
         }
     }

   The convention above rules out such pathological implementations as
`notCorrect1' above; because mention of a formal parameter name, such
as `x' above, in postconditions always means the pre-state value of
that name, e.g., `\old(x)' in the example above.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Diverges Clauses,  Next: When Clauses,  Prev: Parameters in Postconditions,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.7 Diverges Clauses
----------------------

The diverges clause is a seldom-used feature of JML.  It says when a
method may loop forever or otherwise not return to its caller, by
either throwing an exception or returning normally.  The syntax is as
follows *Note Requires Clauses::, for the syntax of PRED-OR-NOT.

     DIVERGES-CLAUSE ::= DIVERGES-KEYWORD PRED-OR-NOT `;'
     DIVERGES-KEYWORD ::= `diverges' | `diverges_redundantly'

   When a diverges clause is omitted in a specification case, a default
diverges clause is used.  For both lightweight and heavyweight
specification cases, the default diverges condition is `false'.  Thus
by default, specification cases give total correctness specifications
[Dijkstra76].  Explicitly writing a diverges clause allows one to
obtain a partial correctness specification [Hoare69].  Being able to
specify both total and partial correctness specification cases for a
method leads to additional power [Hesselink92] [Nelson89].

   As an example of the use of `diverges', consider the `exit' method
in the following class.  (This example is simplified from the
specification of Java's `System.exit' method.  This specification says
that the method can always be called (the implicit precondition is
`true'), may always not return to the caller (i.e., diverge), and may
never return normally, and may never throw an exception.  Thus the only
thing the method can legally do, aside from causing a JVM error, is to
not return to its caller.

     package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

     public abstract class Diverges {

         /*@ public behavior
           @    diverges true;
           @    assignable \nothing;
           @    ensures false;
           @    signals (Exception) false;
           @*/
         public static void abort();

     }

   The diverges clause is also useful to specify things like methods
that are supposed to abort the program when certain conditions occur,
although that isn't really good practice in Java.  In general, it is
most useful for examples like the one given above, when you want to say
when a method cannot return to its caller.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: When Clauses,  Next: Assignable Clauses,  Prev: Diverges Clauses,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.8 When Clauses
------------------

The `when' clause allows concurrency aspects of a method or constructor
to be specified [Lerner91] [Rodriguez-etal05].  A caller of a method
will be delayed until the condition given in the `when' clause holds.
What is checked is that the method does not proceed to its commit
point, which is the start of execution of statement with the label
`commit', until the given predicate is true.

   The syntax is as follows.  *Note Requires Clauses::, for the syntax
of PRED-OR-NOT.

     WHEN-CLAUSE ::= WHEN-KEYWORD PRED-OR-NOT `;'
     WHEN-KEYWORD ::= `when' | `when_redundantly'

   When a when clause is omitted in a specification case, a default when
clause is used.  For a lightweight specification case, the default when
condition is `\not_specified'.  The default when condition for a
heavyweight specification case is `true'.

   See [Rodriguez-etal05] for more about the `when' clause and JML's
plans for support of multithreading.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Assignable Clauses,  Next: Accessible Clauses,  Prev: When Clauses,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.9 Assignable Clauses
------------------------

An assignable clause gives a frame axiom for a specification.  It says
that, from the client's point of view, only the locations named, and
locations in the data groups associated with these locations, can be
assigned to during the execution of the method.  The values of all
subexpressions used in assignable clauses, such as `i-1' in `a[i-1]',
are computed in the pre-state of the method, because the assignable
clause only talks about locations that exist in the pre-state.

   *Note Data Groups::, for more about specification of data groups.
However, locations that are local to the method (or methods it calls)
and locations that are created during the method's execution are not
subject to this restriction.

   The syntax is as follows.  *Note Store Refs::, for the syntax of
STORE-REF-LIST.

     ASSIGNABLE-CLAUSE ::= ASSIGNABLE-KEYWORD STORE-REF-LIST `;'
     ASSIGNABLE-KEYWORD ::= `assignable' | `assignable_redundantly'
             | `modifiable' | `modifiable_redundantly'
             | `modifies' | `modifies_redundantly'

   When an assignable clause is omitted in a specification case, a
default assignable clause is used.  This default has a default
STORE-REF-LIST.  For a lightweight specification case, the default
STORE-REF-LIST is `\not_specified'.  The default STORE-REF-LIST for a
heavyweight specification case is `\everything'.

   If one wants the opposite of the default (for a heavyweight
specification case), then one can specify that a method cannot assign
to any locations by writing:
       assignable \nothing;
   Using the modifier `pure' on a method achieves the same effect as
specifying `assignable \nothing', but does so for the method's entire
specification as opposed to a single SPECIFICATION-CASE.

   Assignable clauses are subject to several restrictive rules in JML.
The first rule has to do with fields of model objects.  Because model
objects are abstract and do not have a concrete state or concrete
fields, the JML typechecker does not allow fields of model objects to
be listed in the assignable clause; that is, such expressions do not
specify a set of locations (concrete fields) that can be assigned to.
Thus expressions like `f.x' are not allowed in the assignable clause
when `f' is a model field.

   [[[Flesh out other restrictions.  Refer to
[Mueller-Poetzsch-Heffter-Leavens03] for details.]]]


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Accessible Clauses,  Next: Callable Clauses,  Prev: Assignable Clauses,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.10 Accessible Clauses
-------------------------

The accessible clause is a seldom-used feature of JML.  Together with
the `assignable' clause (*note Assignable Clauses::), it says what
(pre-existing) locations a method may read during its execution.  It
has the following syntax.

     ACCESSIBLE-CLAUSE ::= ACCESSIBLE-KEYWORD STORE-REF-LIST `;'
     ACCESSIBLE-KEYWORD ::= `accessible' | `accessible_redundantly'

   During execution of the method (which includes all directly and
indirectly called methods and constructors), only locations that either
did not exist in the pre-state, that are local to the method (including
the method's formal parameters), or that are either named in the lists
found in the `accessible' and `assignable' clauses or that are
dependees (*note Data Groups::) of such locations, are read from.  Note
that locations that are local to the method (or methods it calls) and
locations that are created during the method's execution are not
subject to this restriction and may be read from freely.

   When an accessible clause is omitted in a code contract
specification case, a default accessible clause is used.  This default
has a default STORE-REF-LIST which is `\everything'.

   *Note Specification for Subtypes::, for more discussion and examples.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Callable Clauses,  Next: Measured By Clauses,  Prev: Accessible Clauses,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.11 Callable Clauses
-----------------------

The callable clause says what methods may be called, either directly or
indirectly, by the method being specified.  It has the following syntax.

     CALLABLE-CLAUSE ::= CALLABLE-KEYWORD CALLABLE-METHODS-LIST `;'
     CALLABLE-KEYWORD ::= `callable' | `callable_redundantly'
     CALLABLE-METHODS-LIST ::= METHOD-NAME-LIST | STORE-REF-KEYWORD

   During execution of a method, the only methods and constructors that
may be called are those listed in the `callable' clause's list.

   When a callable clause is omitted in a code contract specification
case, a default callable clause is used.  This default has a default
CALLABLE-METHODS-LIST which is `\everything'.

9.9.12 Measured By Clauses
--------------------------

A measured by clause can be used in a termination argument for a
recursive specification.  It has the following syntax.

     MEASURED-CLAUSE ::= MEASURED-BY-KEYWORD `\not_specified' `;'
             | MEASURED-BY-KEYWORD SPEC-EXPRESSION [ `if' PREDICATE ] `;'
     MEASURED-BY-KEYWORD ::= `measured_by' | `measured_by_redundantly'

   The SPEC-EXPRESSION in a measured by clause must have type `int'.

   In both lightweight and heavyweight specification cases, an omitted
measured by clause means the same as a measured by clause of the
following form.
         measured_by \not_specified;


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Captures Clauses,  Next: Working Space Clauses,  Prev: Measured By Clauses,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.13 Captures Clauses
-----------------------

The captures clause has the following syntax.

     CAPTURES-CLAUSE ::= CAPTURES-KEYWORD STORE-REF-LIST `;'
     CAPTURES-KEYWORD ::= `captures' | `captures_redundantly'

   The captures clause says that references to the STORE-REFs listed
can be retained after the method returns, for example in a field of the
receiver object or in a static field.  Therefore, the captures clause
specifies when an object, passed as an actual parameter in a method
call, may be captured during the call.

   An actual parameter object (including the receiver this) is captured
if it appears on the right-hand side of an assignment statement during
the call.  This can also happen indirectly through another method or
constructor call or by returning the parameter object as the method
result (we assume the result will be assigned to a field or local
variable after the call).

   The captures clause is used to prevent certain kinds of
representation exposure as part of an alias control technique.  For
example, if an object should not be aliased, then that object must not
be passed to a method that may capture it, i.e., may create an alias to
it (this includes the receiver).  Furthermore, objects used as part of
the abstract representation of a type should not be aliased, and thus
should not be passed to methods that capture it.  JML tools will
eventually prevent such aliasing.

   When a captures clause is omitted in a method specification case,
then a default captures clause is used.  This default has a default
STORE-REF-LIST which is `\everything'.  Thus when omitted, a method is
allowed to capture any of the actual parameter objects or the receiver.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Working Space Clauses,  Next: Duration Clauses,  Prev: Captures Clauses,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.14 Working Space Clauses
----------------------------

A WORKING-SPACE-CLAUSE can be used to specify the maximum amount of
heap space used by a method, over and above that used by its callers.
The clause applies only to the particular specification case it is in,
of course This is adapted from the work of Krone, Ogden, and Sitaraman
on RESOLVE [Krone-Ogden-Sitaraman03].

     WORKING-SPACE-CLAUSE ::= WORKING-SPACE-KEYWORD `\not_specified' `;'
             | WORKING-SPACE-KEYWORD SPEC-EXPRESSION [ `if' PREDICATE ] `;'
     WORKING-SPACE-KEYWORD ::= `working_space' | `working_space_redundantly'

   The SPEC-EXPRESSION in a working space clause must have type `long'.
It is to be understood in units of bytes.

   The SPEC-EXPRESSION in a working space clause may use `\old' and
other JML operators appropriate for postconditions.  This is because it
is considered to be evaluated in the post-state, and provides a
guarantee of the maximum amount of additional space used by the call.
In some cases this space may depend on the `\result', exceptions
thrown, or other post-state values.  [[[ There is however no way to
identify the exception thrown - DRCok]]]

   In both lightweight and heavyweight specification cases, an omitted
working space clause means the same as a working space clause of the
following form.
         working_space \not_specified;

   *Note Backslash working space::, for information about the
`\working_space' expression that can be used to describe the working
space needed by a method call.  *Note Backslash space::, for

File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Duration Clauses,  Prev: Working Space Clauses,  Up: Method Specification Clauses

9.9.15 Duration Clauses
-----------------------

A duration clause can be used to specify the maximum (i.e., worst case)
time needed to process a method call in a particular specification
case.  [[[ Tools are simpler if the argument can simply be an arbitrary
expression rather than a method call. - DRCok ]]] This is adapted from
the work of Krone, Ogden, and Sitaraman on RESOLVE
[Krone-Ogden-Sitaraman03].

     DURATION-CLAUSE ::= DURATION-KEYWORD `\not_specified' `;'
             | DURATION-KEYWORD SPEC-EXPRESSION [ `if' PREDICATE ] `;'
     DURATION-KEYWORD ::= `duration' | `duration_redundantly'

   The SPEC-EXPRESSION in a duration clause must have type `long'.  It
is to be understood in units of [[[the JVM instruction that takes the
least time to execute, which may be thought of as the JVM's cycle
time.]]]  The time it takes the JVM to execute such an instruction can
be multiplied by the number of such cycles to arrive at the clock time
needed to execute the method in the given specification case.  [[[This
time should also be understood as not counting garbage collection
time.]]]

   The SPEC-EXPRESSION in a duration clause may use `\old' and other
JML operators appropriate for postconditions.  This is because it is
considered to be evaluated in the post-state, and provides a guarantee
of the maximum amount of additional space used by the call.  In some
cases this space may depend on the `\result', exceptions thrown, or
other post-state values.  [[[  There is no way to identify the
exception thrown -  DRCok]]]

   In both lightweight and heavyweight specification cases, an omitted
duration clause means the same as a duration clause of the following
form.
         duration \not_specified;

   *Note Backslash duration::, for information about the `\duration'
expression that can be used in the duration clause to specify the
duration of other methods.


File: jmlrefman.info,  Node: Data Groups,  Next: Predicates and Specification Expressions,  Prev: Method Specifications,  Up: Top

10 Data Groups
**************

A "data group" is a set of locations; data groups are used in JML's
frame axioms (*note Assignable Clauses::) to name such sets of
locations in a way that does not expose representation details
[Leino98].

   Each field in a program defines a data group, whose name is the same
as that of the field.

   The main purpose for putting locations into data groups is so that
these locations may be assigned during the executions of methods that
have permission to assign to the data group.  For example, if locations
`x.f' and `x.y' are in data group `x.d', then an assignable clause of
the form

        assignable x.d;

allows `x.d', `x.f', `x.y', and any other locations in the data group
of `x.d' to be assigned during the execution of a method.

   One should always put private or protected fields that are used to
compute the value of a public model field (*note Represents Clauses::)
into the data group of that model field.  However, one can also put
other fields into a model field's data group, just to allow them to be
assigned when the model field is assignable.

   It is sometimes convenient to declare a data group without any other
information about the model of data.  This can be done using the type
`org.jmlspecs.models.JMLDataGroup'. This type has exactly one non-null
object, named `JMLDataGroup.IT'.  For example, the class
`java.lang.Object' has the following data group declaration.

         // public non_null model JMLDataGroup objectState;

   The `objectState' data group provides a convenient way to talk about
"the state" of an object without committing to any modeling or
representation details.

   [[[ needs discussion - default data groups ]]]

   To place a field or array element in a data group, one uses the
following syntax.

     JML-DATA-GROUP-CLAUSE ::= IN-GROUP-CLAUSE | MAPS-INTO-CLAUSE

   The details of the two kinds of data group clauses are discussed
below.

=================================

     IN-GROUP-CLAUSE ::= IN-KEYWORD GROUP-LIST `;'
     IN-KEYWORD ::= `in' | `in_redundantly'
     GROUP-LIST ::= GROUP-NAME [ `,' GROUP-NAME ] ...
     GROUP-NAME ::= [ GROUP-NAME-PREFIX ] IDENT
     GROUP-NAME-PREFIX ::= `super' `.' | `this' `.'

   The IN-GROUP-CLAUSE puts the field being declared in all the data
groups named in the GROUP-LIST.

10.2 Dynamic Data Group Mappings
================================

*Note Store Refs::, for the definition of SPEC-ARRAY-REF-EXPR.

     MAPS-INTO-CLAUSE ::= MAPS-KEYWORD MEMBER-FIELD-REF `\into' GROUP-LIST `;'
     MAPS-KEYWORD ::= `maps' | `maps_redundantly'
     MEMBER-FIELD-REF ::= IDENT `.' MAPS-MEMBER-REF-EXPR
               | MAPS-ARRAY-REF-EXPR [ `.' MAPS-MEMBER-REF-EXPR ]
     MAPS-MEMBER-REF-EXPR ::= IDENT | `*'
     MAPS-ARRAY-REF-EXPR ::= IDENT MAPS-SPEC-ARRAY-DIM
                             [ MAPS-SPEC-ARRAY-DIM ] ...
     MAPS-SPEC-ARRAY-DIM ::= ``['' SPEC-ARRAY-REF-EXPR ``]''

   The MAPS-INTO-CLAUSE describes elements of a data group that are
determined dynamically, through a field reference or an array index, or
a field of an array index.  The pattern `*' may be used to specify all
fields of an object or all elements of an array.

   The fields of a model object do not denote locations because model
objects are abstract and do not have concrete fields.  Therefore, in
JML, the maps clause is not allowed in the declaration of a model field
because such maps clauses do not denote a specific set of locations to
be added to a data group, and this is the primary purpose of the maps
clause (see also the discussion of model fields in the assignable
clause).

11 Predicates and Specification Expressions
*******************************************

This chapter describes predicates in JML and JML's extensions to Java's
expressions.  It also describes store references, which are similar to
specification expressions, but are used to describe locations instead
of values.  Details are found in the sections below.

11.1 Predicates
===============

A "predicate" The following gives the syntax of predicates, which are
simply SPEC-EXPRESSIONs that must have a boolean value.  *Note
Specification Expressions::, for the syntax of specification
expressions.

     PREDICATE ::= SPEC-EXPRESSION

11.2 Specification Expressions
==============================

The following gives the syntax of specification expressions in JML.
*Note Expressions::, for the syntax of EXPRESSION.

     SPEC-EXPRESSION-LIST ::= SPEC-EXPRESSION
                              [ `,' SPEC-EXPRESSION ] ...
     SPEC-EXPRESSION ::= EXPRESSION

   Within a SPEC-EXPRESSION, one cannot use any of the operators (such
as `++', `--', and the assignment operators) that would necessarily
cause side effects.  In addition, one can use extensions that are
specific to JML, in particular the JML primary expressions.

11.3 Expressions
================

The JML syntax for expressions extends the Java syntax with several
operators and primitives.

   The precedence of operators in JML expressions is similar to that in
Java The precedence levels are given in the following table, where the
parentheses, quantified expressions, `[]', `.', and method calls on the
first three lines all have the highest precedence, and for the rest,
only the operators on the same line have the same precedence.

       highest   `new ()' `\forall' `\exists' `\max' `\min'
                     `\num_of' `\product' `\sum' INFORMAL-DESCRIPTION
                     `[] .' and method calls
                 unary `+' and `-' `~' `!' `('typecast`)'
                 `* / %'
                 `+' (binary) `-' (binary)
                 `<< >> >>>'
                 `< <= > >= <: instanceof'
                 `== !='
                 `&'
                 `^'
                 `|'

                 `?:'
       lowest    `= *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= >>>= &= ^= |='

   The following is the syntax of Java expressions, with JML additions.
The additions are the operators `==>', `<==', `<==>', `<=!=>', and
`<:', and the syntax found under the nonterminals JML-PRIMARY (*note
JML Primary Expressions::) and SET-COMPREHENSION (*note Set
Comprehensions::).  The JML additions to the Java syntax can only be
used in assertions and other annotations.  Furthermore, within
assertions, one cannot use any of the operators (such as `++', `--',
and the assignment operators) that would necessarily cause side effects.

   All of the JML keywords that can be used in expressions which would

11.4.1 `\result'
----------------

The syntax of a RESULT-EXPRESSION is as follows.

     RESULT-EXPRESSION ::= `\result'

   The primary `\result' can only be used in `ensures', `duration', and
`workingspace' clauses of a non-void method.  Its value is the value
returned by the method.  Its type is the return type of the method;
hence it is a type error to use `\result' in a void method or in a
constructor.

11.4.2 `\old' and `\pre'
------------------------

An OLD-EXPRESSION has the following syntax.  *Note Specification
Expressions::, for the syntax of SPEC-EXPRESSION.

     OLD-EXPRESSION ::= `\old' `(' SPEC-EXPRESSION [ `,' IDENT ] `)'
             | `\pre' `(' SPEC-EXPRESSION `)'

   An expression of the form `\old('Expr`)' refers to the value that
the expression Expr had in the pre-state of a method.

   JML uses Java's reference semantics, hence the pre-state value of an
expression whose type is a reference type is simply the reference; it
is _not_ a clone of the object the reference points to.  For example,
suppose in the pre-state that `v' is field that holds a reference to a
`HashMap'; concretely, suppose that the location stored in `v' is
0x952ab340.  Then the expression `\old(v)' denotes the pre-state value
of `v', which is the same reference, i.e., it is the address
0x952ab340.  Note that `\old(v)' is not a reference to a copy of the
`HashMap' stored at that location, but simply a copy of the location's
address (the reference), which is the value of `v'.  If the fields of
the object at that location have changed in the post-state, then
changes to those fields will be visible through `\old(v)'; for example,
`\old(v).size()' will be the same as `v.size()'.  To write a
post-condition that refers to `v''s size in the pre-state, one should
instead write `\old(v.size())'.  Indeed as a general rule, it is always
safest to use `\old()' only around expressions whose type is a value
type or a type with immutable values, such as `String'.

   Expressions of this form may be used in both normal and exceptional
postconditions (*note Method Specifications::, for more about such
`ensures' and `signals' clauses), in history constraints, in duration
and working space clauses, and also in assertions that appear in the
bodies of methods (*note Statements and Annotation Statements::, for
more about `assert' and `assume' statements, loop invariants, and
variant functions).

   However, we recommend that inside the bodies of methods, one of the
two other forms of OLD-EXPRESSION (see below) be used instead.  The
reason for this is that the reader may wonder whether `\old(Expr)' in
the body of a method means the pre-state value of Expr (which it does)
or the value of Expr before some previous statement (which it does not).

   An expression of the form `\pre('Expr`)' also refers to the value
that the expression Expr had in the pre-state of a method.  Expressions
of this form may only be used in assertions that appear in the bodies
of methods (i.e., in `assert' and `assume' statements, and in loop
invariants and variant functions).  That is, such expressions may not
be used in specification cases, and hence may not appear in normal or
exceptional postconditions, in history constraints, or in duration and
working space clauses.

   An expression of the form `\old('Expr`,' Label`)' refers to the
value that the expression Expr had when control last reached the
statement label Label.  That is, it refers to the value of the
expression just before control reached the statement the label is
attached to.  Expressions of this form may only be used in assertions
that appear in the bodies of methods (i.e., in `assert' and `assume'
statements, and in loop invariants and variant functions).  That is,
such expressions may not be used in specification cases, and hence may
not appear in normal or exceptional postconditions, in history
constraints, or in duration and working space clauses.

   In an expression of the form `\old('Expr`,' Label`)', Label must be
a label defined in the current method.  The type of `\old('Expr`)',
`\old('Expr`,' Label`)', or `\pre('Expr`)', is simply the type of Expr.

   It is a type error if `\old()' or `\pre()' encloses a free
occurrence of a quantified variable.  For example, in the following,
`\old()' encloses a free occurrence of the quantified variable `i',
which is declared in the surrounding quantifier, and thus the example
is illegal.
         (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < 7; \old(i < y))  // illegal
   The problem with the above example is that there is no easy way to
evaluate `\old(i < y)' in the pre-state.

   However, constructions like the following are legal, as in the first
the use of `\old()' does not enclose the quantified variable, `i', and
in the second use of `\old()' does not enclose a free occurrence of the
quantified variable (the variable is bound by the declaration which is
inside of `\old()'.

          (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < 7; i < \old(y))  // ok
          \old((\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < 7; i < y))  // ok

The syntax of a NOT-ASSIGNED-EXPRESSION is as follows.  *Note Store
Refs::, for the syntax of STORE-REF-LIST.

     NOT-ASSIGNED-EXPRESSION ::= `\not_assigned' `(' STORE-REF-LIST `)'

   The JML operator `\not_assigned' can be used in both normal and
exceptional preconditions (i.e., in `ensures' and `signals' clauses),
and in history constraints.  It asserts that the locations in the data
group (*note Data Groups::) named by the argument were not assigned to
during the execution of the method being specified (or all methods to
which a history constraint applies).  For example,
`\not_assigned(xval,yval)' says that the locations in the data groups
named by `xval' and `yval' were not assigned during the method's
execution.

   A predicate such as `\not_assigned(x.f)' refers to the entire data
group named by `x.f' not just to the location `x.f' itself.  This
allows one to specify absence of even temporary side-effects in various
cases of a method.  *Note Backslash not_modified::, for ways to specify
that just the value of a given field was not changed, which allows
temporary side effects.

   The `\not_assigned' operator can be applied to both concrete and
model or ghost fields.  When applied to a model field, the meaning is
that all (concrete) locations in that model field's data group were not
assigned.  [[[A real example would help here.]]]

   The type of a `\not_assigned' expression is `boolean'.

The syntax of a NOT-MODIFIED-EXPRESSION is as follows.  *Note Store

     NOT-MODIFIED-EXPRESSION ::= `\not_modified' `(' STORE-REF-LIST `)'

   The JML operator `\not_modified' can be used in both normal and
exceptional preconditions (i.e., in `ensures' and `signals' clauses),
and in history constraints.  It asserts that the values of the named
fields are the same in the post-state as in the pre-state; for example,
`\not_modified(xval,yval)' says that the fields `xval' and `yval' have
the same value in the pre- and post-states (in the sense of the
`equals' method for their types).

   A predicate such as `\not_modified(x.f)' refers to the location
named by `x.f', not to the entire data group of `x.f'.  This allows one
to specify benevolent side-effects, as one can name `x.f' (or a data
group in which it participates) in an assignable clause, but use
`\not_modified(x.f)' in the postcondition.  *Note Backslash
not_assigned::, for ways to specify that no assignments were made to
any location in a data group, disallowing temporary side effects.

   The `\not_modified' operator can be applied to both concrete and
model or ghost fields.  When applied to a model field, the meaning is
that only the value of the model field is unchanged (in the sense of
its type's equals operation); concrete fields involved in its
representation may have changed.  [[[A real example would help here.]]]

   The type of a `\not_modified' expression is `boolean'.

The syntax of an ONLY-ACCESSED-EXPRESSION is as follows.  *Note Store

     ONLY-ACCESSED-EXPRESSION ::= `\only_accessed' `(' STORE-REF-LIST `)'

   The JML operator `\only_accessed' can be used in both normal and
exceptional preconditions (i.e., in `ensures' and `signals' clauses),
and in history constraints.  Used in a method's postcondition (perhaps
implicitly in a history constraint), it asserts that the method's
execution only reads from a subset of the data groups named by the
given fields.  For example, `\only_accessed(xval,yval)' says that no
fields, outside of the data groups of `xval' and `yval' were read by
the method. This includes both direct reads in the body of the method,
and reads during calls that were made by the method (and methods those
methods called, etc.).

   A predicate such as `\only_accessed(x.f)' refers to the entire data
group named by `x.f' not just to the location `x.f' itself.

   The `\only_accessed' operator can be applied to both concrete and
model or ghost fields.  When applied to a model field, the meaning is
that the (concrete) locations in that model field's data group are
permitted to be accessed during the method's execution.

   The JML operator `\only_assigned' can be used in both normal and

   The JML operator `\only_called' can be used in both normal and
exceptional preconditions (i.e., in `ensures' and `signals' clauses),
and in history constraints.  Used in a method's postcondition (perhaps
implicitly in a history constraint), it asserts that the method's
execution only called from a subset of methods given in the
METHOD-NAME-LIST.  For example, `\only_called(p,q)' says that methods,
apart from `p' and `q', were called during this method's execution.

The syntax of an ONLY-CAPTURED-EXPRESSION is as follows.  *Note Store
Refs::, for the syntax of STORE-REF-LIST.

     ONLY-CAPTURED-EXPRESSION ::= `\only_captured' `(' STORE-REF-LIST `)'

   The JML operator `\only_captured' can be used in both normal and
exceptional preconditions (i.e., in `ensures' and `signals' clauses),
and in history constraints.  Used in a method's postcondition (perhaps
implicitly in a history constraint), it asserts that the method's
execution only captured references from a subset of the data groups
named by the given fields.  For example, `\only_captured(xv,yv)' says
that no references, outside of the data groups of `xv' and `yv' were
captured by the method.

   A reference is "captured" when it is stored into a field (as opposed
to a local variable).  Typically a method captures a formal parameter
(or a reference stored in a static field) by assigning it to a field in
the method's receiver (the `this' object), a field in some object (or
to an array element), or to a static field.

   A predicate such as `\only_captured(x.f)' refers to the references
stored in the entire data group named by `x.f' in the pre-state, not
just to those stored in the location `x.f' itself.  However, since the
references being captured are usually found in formal parameters, the
complications of data groups can usually be ignored.

   The `\only_captured' operator can be applied to both concrete and
model or ghost fields.  When applied to a model field, the meaning is
that the (concrete) locations in that model field's data group are
permitted to be captured during the method's execution.

   The type of an `\only_captured' expression is `boolean'.

---------------

The syntax of a FRESH-EXPRESSION is as follows.  *Note Specification
Expressions::, for the syntax of SPEC-EXPRESSION-LIST.

     FRESH-EXPRESSION ::= `\fresh' `(' SPEC-EXPRESSION-LIST `)'

   The operator `\fresh' asserts that objects were freshly allocated;
for example, `\fresh(x,y)' asserts that `x' and `y' are not null and
that the objects bound to these identifiers were not allocated in the
pre-state.  The arguments to `\fresh' can have any reference type, and
the type of the overall expression is `boolean'.

   Note that it is wrong to use `\fresh(this)' in the specification of
a constructor, because Java's `new' operator allocates storage for the
object; the constructor's job is just to initialize that storage.

The syntax of a REACH-EXPRESSION is as follows.  *Note Specification

   The `\reach' expression allows one to refer to the set of objects
reachable from some particular object.  The syntax `\reach('x`)'
denotes the smallest `JMLObjectSet' containing the object denoted by x,
if any, and all objects accessible through all fields of objects in
this set.  That is, if x is `null', then this set is empty otherwise it
contains x, all objects accessible through all fields of x, all objects
accessible through all fields of these objects, and so on, recursively.
If x denotes a model field (or data group), then `\reach('x`)' denotes
the smallest `JMLObjectSet' containing the objects reachable from x or
reachable from the objects referenced by fields in that data group.

-------------------

The syntax of a DURATION-EXPRESSION is as follows.  *Note
Expressions::, for the syntax of EXPRESSION.

     DURATION-EXPRESSION ::= `\duration' `(' EXPRESSION `)'

   `\duration', which describes the specified maximum number of virtual
machine cycle times needed to execute the method call or explicit
constructor invocation expression that is its argument; e.g.,
`\duration(myStack.push(o))' is the maximum number of virtual machine
cycles needed to execute the call `myStack.push(o)', according to the
contract of the static type of `myStack''s type's `push' method, when
passed argument `o'.  Note that the expression used as an argument to
`\duration' should be thought of as quoted, in the sense that it is not
to be executed; thus the method or constructor called need not be free
of side effects.  Note that the argument to `\duration' is an
EXPRESSION instead of just the name of a method, because different
method calls, i.e., those with different parameters, can take different
amounts of time [Krone-Ogden-Sitaraman03].

   The argument expression passed to `\duration' must be a method call
or explicit constructor invocation expression; the type of a
`\duration' expression is `long'.

   For a given Java Virtual Machine, a "virtual machine cycle" is
defined to be the minimum of the maximum over all Java Virtual Machine
instructions, i, of the length of time needed to execute instruction i.

     SPACE-EXPRESSION ::= `\space' `(' SPEC-EXPRESSION `)'

   `\space', which describes the amount of heap space, in bytes,
allocated to the object referred to by its argument
[Krone-Ogden-Sitaraman03]; e.g., `\space(myStack)' is number of bytes
in the heap used by `myStack', not including the objects it contains.

     WORKING-SPACE-EXPRESSION ::= `\working_space' `(' EXPRESSION `)'

   `\working_space', which describes the maximum specified amount of
heap space, in bytes, used by the method call or explicit constructor
invocation expression that is its argument; e.g.,
`\working_space(myStack.push(o))' is the maximum number of bytes needed
on the heap to execute the call `myStack.push(o)', according to the
contract of the static type of `myStack''s type's `push' method, when
passed argument `o'.  Note that the expression used as an argument to
`\working_space' should be thought of as quoted, in the sense that it
is not to be executed; thus the method or constructor called need not
be free of side effects.  The detailed arguments are needed in the
specification of the call because different method calls, i.e., those
with different parameters, can use take different amounts of space
[Krone-Ogden-Sitaraman03].  The argument expression must be a method
call or explicit constructor invocation expression; the result type of
a `\working_space' expression is `long'.

   The operator `\nonnullelements' can be used to assert that an array
and its elements are all non-null.  For example,
`\nonnullelements(myArray)', is equivalent to [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00]

       myArray != null &&
       (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < myArray.length;

An INFORMAL-DESCRIPTION is some text enclosed in `(*' and `*)'.  *Note

formality.

   An informal description used as a predicate has type boolean.  Hence
the text in an informal description should describe a condition, for
example `(* the value of x is displayed *)'.

   The value of an informal description is only known to the user, not
to any JML tools, so it is never executable.  Informal descriptions
should thus be avoided when possible, but can be used to avoid
formalizing everything when doing so would be too expensive.

-----------------

The syntax of a TYPEOF-EXPRESSION is as follows.  *Note Specification
Expressions::, for the syntax of SPEC-EXPRESSION.

     TYPEOF-EXPRESSION ::= `\typeof' `(' SPEC-EXPRESSION `)'

   The operator `\typeof' returns the most-specific dynamic type of an
expression's value [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00].  The meaning of
`\typeof('E`)' is unspecified if E is null.  If E has a static type
that is a reference type, then `\typeof('E`)' means the same thing as
E`.getClass()'.  For example, if `c' is a variable of static type
`Collection' that holds an object of class `HashSet', then `\typeof(c)'
is `HashSet.class', which is the same thing as `\type(HashSet)'.  If E
has a static type that is not a reference type, then `\typeof('E`)'
means the instance of `java.lang.Class' that represents its static type.
For example, `\typeof(true)' is `Boolean.TYPE', which is the same as
`\type(boolean)'.  Thus an expression of the form `\typeof('E`)' has
type `\TYPE', which JML considers to be the same as `java.lang.Class'.

11.4.17 `\elemtype'
-------------------

The syntax of a ELEMTYPE-EXPRESSION is as follows.

   The `\elemtype' operator returns the most-specific static type
shared by all elements of its array argument [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00].  For
example, `\elemtype(\type(int[]))' is `\type(int)'.  The argument to
`\elemtype' must be an expression of type `\TYPE', which JML considers
to be the same as `java.lang.Class', and its result also has type
`\TYPE' (*note Type-Specs::).  If the argument is not an array type,
then the result is `null'.  For example, `\elemtype(\type(int))' and
`\elemtype(\type(Object))' are both `null'.

11.4.18 `\type'
---------------

The syntax of a TYPE-EXPRESSION is as follows.  *Note Type-Specs::, for
the syntax of TYPE.

     TYPE-EXPRESSION ::= `\type' `(' TYPE `)'
   The operator `\type' can be used to introduce literals of type
`\TYPE' in expressions.  An expression of the form `\type(T)', where
`T' is a type name, has the type `\TYPE'.  Since in JML `\TYPE' is the
same as `java.lang.Class', an expression of the form `\type('T`)' means
the same thing as T`.class', if T is a reference type.  If T is a
primitive type, then `\type(T)' is equivalent to the value of the
`TYPE' field of the corresponding reference type.  Thus
`\type(boolean)' equals `Boolean.TYPE'.

   For example, in

        \typeof(myObj) <: \type(PlusAccount)

the use of `\type(PlusAccount)' is used to introduce the type
`PlusAccount' into this expression context.

   The `\max' operator returns the "largest" (as defined by `<') of a

of `MyClass'.  The entire `\invariant_for' expression is of type
`boolean'.

-------------------------------

The syntax of the two kinds of labeled expressions is as follows.
*Note Specification Expressions::, for the syntax of SPEC-EXPRESSION.

     LBLNEG-EXPRESSION ::= `(' `\lblneg' IDENT SPEC-EXPRESSION `)'
     LBLPOS-EXPRESSION ::= `(' `\lblpos' IDENT SPEC-EXPRESSION `)'

   Parenthesized expressions that start with `\lblneg' and `\lblpos'
can be used to attach labels to expressions [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00];
these labels might be printed in various messages by support tools, for
example, to identify an assertion that failed.  Such an expression has
a "label" and a "body"; for example, in

        (\lblneg indexInBounds 0 <= index && index < length)

the label is `indexInBounds' and the body is the expression `0 <= index
&& index < length'.  The value of a labeled expression is the value of
its body, hence its type is the type of its body.  The idea is that if
this expression is used in an assertion and its value is `false' (e.g.,
when doing run-time checking of assertions), then a warning will be
printed that includes the label `indexInBounds'.  The form using
`\lblpos' has a similar syntax, but should be used for warnings when
the value of the enclosed expression is `true'.

     SPEC-INITIALIZER ::= SPEC-EXPRESSION
             | SPEC-ARRAY-INITIALIZER

   Note that each quantified expression includes a set of parentheses;
these parentheses cannot be omitted.  The first part of a quantified
expression is the QUANTIFIER, which determines the operation to be
performed. Every quantifier starts with a backslash (`\').  Following
the quantifier are QUANTIFIED-VAR-DECLS, which declare "bound
variables" whose scope is the SPEC-QUANTIFIED-EXPR. The bound variables
may not conflict with existing local variables, but may hide static and
instance fields. The optional predicate between the two semicolons is
the "range predicate"; a quantifier ranges over all possible values of
its bound variables that satisfy the range predicate (for a discussion
of the ranges of values for reference types, *note Quantifying over
Reference Types::). If the range predicate is omitted, it defaults to
