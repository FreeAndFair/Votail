This chapter explains JML's notion of refinement files, which uses the
following syntax.

</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <VAR>refine-prefix</VAR> in a compilation unit says that the
declarations in this compilation unit refine the corresponding
declarations in the file named by the <VAR>string-literal</VAR>.  The
<VAR>string-literal</VAR> should name a file, complete with a suffix, for
example, <CODE>"MyType.java-refined"</CODE>.  The suffix of such a file is
used by JML tools to find the file that is the base of a refinement
chain, and all other files in the chain are found using the files
named in the <VAR>refine-prefix</VAR> of a previous file in the chain.
</P><P>

One can use either keyword, <CODE>refine</CODE> or <CODE>refines</CODE> in a
<VAR>refine-prefix</VAR>, although for historical reasons most examples use
<CODE>refine</CODE>.
</P><P>

The following gives more details about the checks and meaning of this
feature of JML.

The JML tools recognize several filename suffixes.  The following are
considered to be <EM>active</EM> suffixes: <TT>`.refines-java'</TT>,
<TT>`.refines-spec'</TT>, <TT>`.refines-jml'</TT>, <TT>`.java'</TT>, <TT>`.spec'</TT>,
and <TT>`.jml'</TT>; There are also three <EM>passive</EM> suffixes:
<TT>`.java-refined'</TT>, <TT>`.spec-refined'</TT>, and <TT>`.jml-refined'</TT>.
Files with passive suffixes can be used in refinements but should not
normally be passed explicitly to the tools directly.
These filename suffixes are ordered from most active to least active,
in the order given above.
Graphical user interface tools for JML should, by default,
only present the active suffixes for selection.
Among files in a directory with the same prefix,
but with different active suffixes, the one whose suffix appears first
in the list of active suffixes above should be considered primary
by such a tool.
</P><P>

See section <A HREF="jmlrefman_16.html#SEC195">16.2 Using Separate Files</A>, for guidelines on how to use these
suffixes.
See section <A HREF="jmlrefman_16.html#SEC196">16.3 Refinement Chains</A>, for details on the semantics of
specifications written using separate files.

Typically, JML specifications are written into annotation comments in
<TT>`.java'</TT> files, and this is certainly the simplest way to use JML
and its tools. 
</P><P>

However, there are some circumstances in which one may wish to
separate the specification from the Java code.  An important example
of this is when you do not own the sources for the Java code, but wish
to specify it.  This might happen if you are specifying a class
library or framework that you are using. When you do not have control
of the code, it is best to put the specification in a different file.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2853"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2854"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2855"></A>
To add specifications to such a library or framework,
one would use a filename with an active suffix,
such as <TT>`.refines-java'</TT> (or <TT>`.refines-spec'</TT> or
<TT>`.refines-jml'</TT>). The file with such a name would hold
the specifications of the corresponding
Java compilation unit.  For example, if one wants to specify the type
<CODE>LibraryType</CODE>, without touching the file <TT>`LibraryType.java'</TT>
then one could write specifications in the file
<TT>`LibraryType.refines-java'</TT>, and include in that file the following
<VAR>refine-prefix</VAR>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2856"></A>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>  refine "LibraryType.java";
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2857"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2858"></A>
If you are specifying code for which no sources are available (a
class library in binary form), then you should use the <TT>`.spec'</TT> or
<TT>`.jml'</TT> suffixes to write the specification.  Such specifications
act much like those written in <TT>`.refines-spec'</TT> or
<TT>`.refines-jml'</TT> files, but would not include a
<VAR>refine-prefix</VAR>.
They allow specifications to be written without having to write Java
code for the bodies of methods (as do all non-<TT>`.java'</TT>) files.
</P><P>

Another reason for writing specifications in different files is to
prevent the specifications from "cluttering up" the code (making it
hard to see all of the code at once). This is also possible by using
separate files for the specification and the code.
In such a case one has a choice of suffixes, depending on whether one
considers the code to be primary or the specification.  If the code is
primary, or has been written already, then one can treat the code as
if it were written in an extra library, using the <TT>`.refines-java'</TT>
(or <TT>`.refines-spec'</TT> or <TT>`.refines-jml'</TT>) suffixes to specify the
Java files as above.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2859"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2860"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2861"></A>
On the other hand, if the specification is primary, or is to be
written first, one could instead use the <TT>`.java-refined'</TT>
(or <TT>`.spec-refined'</TT> or <TT>`.jml-refined'</TT>) suffixes,
and then write a <VAR>refine-prefix</VAR> in the <TT>`.java'</TT> file.
For example, one might specify
the class <CODE>MyType</CODE> in a file named <TT>`MyType.java-refined'</TT>.
Then one could write the implementation of <CODE>MyType</CODE> in a file
called <TT>`MyType.java'</TT>.  The file <TT>`MyType.java'</TT> would include
the following <VAR>refine-prefix</VAR>:
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2862"></A>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>  refine "MyType.java-refined";
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this case,
the specification found in <TT>`MyType.java-refined'</TT>
<EM>is a refinement</EM> of the implementation found in <TT>`MyType.java'</TT>.
</P><P>

Combinations of these techniques can also be used, by using several
files instead of just a code file and a specification file.
See section <A HREF="jmlrefman_16.html#SEC196">16.3 Refinement Chains</A>, for the meaning of JML specifications in
this general case.
</P><P>

To summarize, aside from the standard <TT>`.java'</TT> suffix,
one would use file name suffixes as follows.
<UL>
<LI>
If you are specifying before coding, but
want to keep the specifications in a different file,
but you want to have the <TT>`.java'</TT> file refer directly to the
specification, then use one of the 
suffixes: <TT>`.java-refined'</TT>, <TT>`.spec-refined'</TT>, or
<TT>`.jml-refined'</TT>).  The <TT>`.java'</TT> file would name the file it
refines (as would other files in the chain) in a <VAR>refine-prefix</VAR>.
<P>

<LI>
If you have a <TT>`.java'</TT> file, but the <VAR>refine-prefix</VAR> cannot
or should not appear in that <TT>`.java'</TT> file, then use one of the
suffixes: <TT>`.refines-java'</TT>, <TT>`.refines-spec'</TT>, or
<TT>`.refines-jml'</TT>.
<P>

<LI>
If there is no <TT>`.java'</TT> source file that will be available to the
tools, the specify the type using a <TT>`.spec'</TT> or <TT>`.jml'</TT> file,
without using a <VAR>refine-prefix</VAR>.

<H2> 16.3 Refinement Chains </H2>
<!--docid::SEC196::-->
<P>

Compilation Units that jointly give the specifications of a type form a
refinement chain.  It begins at a base (or most-refined) compilation unit,
proceeding by means of the <CODE>refine</CODE> annotation links, until a file
is found that has no <CODE>refine</CODE> statement.  That file is the end of
the refinement chain and is the least-refined compilation unit.
</P><P>

For a given type in a given package, the base of the refinement chain is
found as follows.  Each entry of the classpath is searched in order for a 
directory whose name matches the package of the type and that contains a file
whose name has a prefix matching the type name and a suffix that is an active
suffix as defined above.  The first such file found is the base of the
refinement chain.  If the first classpath entry to contain a candidate file
contains more than one candidate file, then the file with the most active
suffix is the base of the chain.
</P><P>

The subsequent elements of the refinement chain are given by the filenames
provided in the <CODE>refine</CODE> statements.  Each element of the chain is in
the same package.  Thus the file corresponding to the <CODE>refine</CODE> 
statement is the first file found by searching the classpath entries in
order and that is in the directory corresponding to the package of the type
and has the filename and suffix given in the <CODE>refine</CODE> statement.
</P><P>

To help ensure that the base is correctly selected, the file with the
most active suffix must be the base of a refinement sequence, otherwise
the JML typechecker issues an error message.  Also, the prefix of the
base file must be the same as the public type declared in that
compilation unit or an error message is issued.  However, it is not
necessary that the file being refined have the same prefix as the file
at the base of the refinement chain (except that the .java file, if it is
in the refinement sequence, must have a name given by the Java rules for
naming compilation units).  Furthermore, a file with the same
prefix as the base file may not be in a different refinement sequence.
For example, <TT>`SomeName.java-refined'</TT> can be refined by
<TT>`MyType.java'</TT> as long as there is no refinement sequence with
<TT>`SomeName'</TT> as the prefix of the base of another refinement.
</P><P>

The JML tools deal with all files in a refinement chain whenever one of
them is selected for processing by the tool.  This allows all of the
specifications that apply to be consistently dealt with at all times.
For example, suppose that there are files named <TT>`Foo.refines-java'</TT>
and <TT>`Foo.java'</TT>, then if a tool selects the <TT>`Foo.java'</TT>, e.g.,
with the command:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>   jmlc *.java
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

then it will see both the <TT>`Foo.refines-java'</TT> and the
<TT>`Foo.java'</TT> file (as long as <TT>`Foo.refines-java'</TT> appears in
a specification path directory before or with <TT>`Foo.java'</TT>).
</P><P>

A given .java file (that is, compilation unit)
may have more than one top-level class declaration
within it.  Only one may be public, and Java requires that the name of that
type match the name of the file, so that the definition of the type can be
found in the file system.  The non-public types within that 
compilation unit may be 
referred to only within that compilation unit.  Consequently, all specifications
of those non-public types must occur along with the specifications of the 
public type in that compilation unit.  For example, suppose a file <TT>`A.java'</TT>
contains the Java declaration of types <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE>.  Then if the
specifications of type <CODE>A</CODE> are in <TT>`A.refines-java'</TT>, the specifications of
type <CODE>B</CODE> must also be in <TT>`A.refines-java'</TT>.  For simple one-file programs,
the one compilation unit may contain only non-public types.  Then the specifications
for those types are found in specification files with the same prefix as the filename
of the Java file containing the type declarations.

<P>

There are some restrictions on what can appear in the different files
involved in a particular refinement.  Since the Java compilers only
see the <TT>`.java'</TT> files, executable code (that is not just for use
in specifications) should only be placed in the <TT>`.java'</TT> files.
In particular the following restrictions are enforced by JML.

<A NAME="IDX2870"></A>
When the same method is declared in more than one file in a refinement
sequence, most parts of the method declaration must be identical in
all the files.  (Two method declarations are considered to be
declaring the <EM>same method</EM> if they have the same signature, i.e.,
same name, same generic type parameters, and static formal parameter types.)  
However, in addition to
the signature of such a method, the return type, the names of the
formal parameters, the declared exceptions the method may throw, and
the non-JML modifiers <CODE>public</CODE>, <CODE>protected</CODE>, <CODE>private</CODE>,
<CODE>static</CODE>, and <CODE>final</CODE>, must all match exactly in each such
declaration in a refinement chain.
<P>

<LI>
<A NAME="IDX2871"></A>
The <CODE>model</CODE> modifier must appear in all declarations of a given
method or it must appear in none of them.  It is not permitted to
implement a model method with a non-model method or to refine a
non-model method with a model method.  Use a <CODE>spec_public</CODE> or
<CODE>spec_protected</CODE> method if you want to use a non-model method in a
specification.  Also, there may be no nesting of model declarations: 
model classes and model methods may not contain model or ghost declarations.

<A NAME="IDX2876"></A>
Some of the JML method modifiers do not always have to match in all
declarations of the same method in a refinement chain.  One may add
<CODE>pure</CODE>, <CODE>non_null</CODE>, <CODE>nullable</CODE>, <CODE>spec_public</CODE>, or
<CODE>spec_protected</CODE> to any of the declarations for a method in any
file.  However, if <CODE>pure</CODE> is added to a method specification,
then all subsequent declarations of that method in a refinement
sequence must also be declared <CODE>pure</CODE>.  Also, it is, of course,
not permitted to add <CODE>spec_protected</CODE> to a method that has been
declared <CODE>public</CODE> or <CODE>spec_public</CODE> in other declarations.
One can add <CODE>non_null</CODE> or <CODE>nullable</CODE> to any formal parameter in any file,
although good style suggests that all of these annotations appear on
one declaration of that method.

<A NAME="IDX2878"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2879"></A>
The specification of a refining method declaration must start with the
JML keyword <CODE>also</CODE>; if it does not an error message is issued.  A
<EM>refining method declaration</EM> is a declaration that overrides a
superclass method or refines the specification of the same method in a
refinement chain.  In JML, method specifications are inherited by
subclasses and in refinement chains.  The <CODE>also</CODE> keyword
indicates that the current specification is refining the specification
inherited either from the superclass or from the previous declaration
of the method in a refinement sequence.  Therefore, it is an error if
the specification of a non-refining method begins with <CODE>also</CODE>
(unless it overrides an inherited method).

If a non-model method has a body, then the body can only appear in a
<TT>`.java'</TT> file; an error message is issued if the body of a
non-model method appears in a file with any other suffix.
Furthermore, the body of a model method may only appear in one file of
a refinement sequence.  This means that each method of each class can
have at most one method body.

When the same field is declared in more than one file in a refinement

signature of such a field, including its type, the non-JML modifiers
<CODE>public</CODE>, <CODE>protected</CODE>, <CODE>private</CODE>, <CODE>static</CODE>, and

In refinements, specification inheritance allows the specifier to
separate the public, protected, and private specifications into
different files.  Public specifications give the public behavior and are
meant for clients of the class.  Protected specifications are meant for
programmers creating subclasses and give the protected behavior of the
type; they give the behavior of protected methods and fields that are
not visible to clients.  Similarly, private specifications are meant for
implementors of the class and provide the behavior related to private
methods and fields of the class; implementors must satisfy the combined
public, protected, and private specifications of a method.

<!--docid::SEC199::-->
<P>

In Java, a default constructor is automatically generated for a class 
when no constructors are declared in a class. 
However, in JML, a default constructor is not generated for a class unless 
the file suffix is <TT>`.java'</TT> 
(the same constructor is generated as in the Java language). 
Consider, for example, the refinement sequence defined by the
following three files, <CODE>RefineDemo.jml-refined</CODE>,
<CODE>RefineDemo.jml</CODE>, and <CODE>RefineDemo.java</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2907"></A>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>// ---- file RefineDemo.jml-refined ---
package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

public class RefineDemo {
   //@ public model int x;

   /*@ public normal_behavior
     @    assignable x;
     @    ensures x == 0; @*/
   public RefineDemo();
}

</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2908"></A>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>// ---- file RefineDemo.jml -----------
package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

//@ refine "RefineDemo.jml-refined"; 

public class RefineDemo {
   protected int x_; 
   //@           in x;

   //@ protected represents x &#60;- x_;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2909"></A>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>// ---- file RefineDemo.java ---------
package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

//@ refine "RefineDemo.jml"; 

public class RefineDemo {
   protected int x_; 
   public RefineDemo() { x_ = 0; }
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In the protected specification declared in <TT>`RefineDemo.jml'</TT>, 
no constructor is defined.  
If JML were to generate a default constructor for this class declaration, 
then the <CODE>public</CODE> constructor defined 
earlier in the refinement chain, in <TT>`RefineDemo.jml-refined'</TT>, 
could have a visibility modifier 
that conflicts with the one automatically generated for the protected 
specification. (The visibility modifier of an automatically generated 
default constructor depends on other factors including the visibility 
of the class.  See section <A HREF="jmlrefman_9.html#SEC84">9.4 Lightweight Specification Cases</A>, for more details.) 
Recall that the signature, including the visibility modifier, must 
match for every method and constructor declared in a refinement chain.  
To avoid such conflicts, JML does not generate a default constructor unless 
the file suffix is <TT>`.java'</TT> (as part of the standard 
compilation process). 
</P><P>

A similar problem can occur when the only constructor is protected or 
private as in the refinement sequence defined by the
following three files, <CODE>RefineDemo2.jml-refined</CODE>,
<CODE>RefineDemo2.jml</CODE>, and <CODE>RefineDemo2.java</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2910"></A>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>// ---- file RefineDemo2.jml-refined --
package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

public class RefineDemo2 {
   //@ public model int x;
   //@ public initially x == 0;
}

</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2911"></A>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>// ---- file RefineDemo2.jml ----------
package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

//@ refine "RefineDemo2.jml-refined"; 
public class RefineDemo2 {
   protected int x_; 
   //@           in x;

   //@ protected represents x &#60;- x_;

   /*@ protected normal_behavior
     @    assignable x;
     @    ensures x == 0; @*/
   protected RefineDemo2();
}

</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2912"></A>
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>// ---- file RefineDemo2.java ---------
package org.jmlspecs.samples.jmlrefman;

//@ refine "RefineDemo2.jml"; 
public class RefineDemo2 {
   protected int x_; 
   protected RefineDemo2() { x_ = 0; }
}

</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In this example, notice that 
no constructor is defined for the public specification 
in <TT>`RefineDemo2.jml-refined'</TT>.
If a default constructor were generated for this class declaration, 
then the <CODE>protected</CODE> constructor defined 
later in the refinement chain, in <TT>`RefineDemo2.jml'</TT>, 
would have a visibility modifier 
that conflicts with the one automatically generated and 
JML would emit an error. 
Thus JML only generates the default constructor for the executable 
declaration of a class in the <TT>`.java'</TT> file and only when required by the 
Java language.
