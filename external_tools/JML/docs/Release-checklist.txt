		Developer's release checklist for JML2

This document is used internally at Iowa State to help make JML releases.
(It assumes you have CYGWIN installed on your Windows machine.)
Users of JML can ignore it.

* Be sure you're in the right place and in the jml group

	newgrp jml
	exec bash
	cd ~/JML2
	id
	pwd

* Note: for things to work below, the "make" command needs to be a
  version of GNU Make.  But this is already standard for our
  development, and is standard under Linux and Cygwin.
  Also, the release procedure must be executed on machine with network access.

* Change the VERSION macro in the top-level Makefile
  and update the messages for the ftp directory (just once!)

	emacs Makefile
	JML_DEV_BASE=$HOME source ~/bin/jml-sourceme.sh
	make ftp.README ftp.message

* edit the NEWS.txt and highlights.txt file

	emacs NEWS.txt highlights.txt

* Update the "version" of the TOOLS

	emacs org/jmlspecs/checker/JmlVersionOptions.opt

* Are all the samples updated?  The documents?
  Are the manual pages in docs/man/*.1 up to date?
  Is the html index in JML.html (this isn't ~/WWW/JML.html!) updated?

* Set up special environment variables for the install by running on cygwin

	cd ~/JML2
	TEMP=$HOME/temp
	export TEMP
	source bin-for-developers/jml-temp-sourceme-cygwin.sh

  or on Linux:

	cd ~/JML2
	TEMP=$HOME/temp
	export TEMP
	source bin-for-developers/jml-temp-sourceme-unix.sh

* Commit and tag the distribution by running, from ~/JML2
  the commands:

	make PLSL_CLASSROOT="${HOME}/MJ" update-for-release tag-for-release

* If you need to retag the release, because an earlier version was
 tagged, then do the following.

	make untag-wrongly-tagged

and if that worked fine...

	rm ../untag-script

* Extract and build the release, and make the tar file
  in the $HOME/temp directory

	make JAVAC=javac build-release tar

* To test the build, install it, on cygwin:

        cd ~/JML2
	TEMP=/home/temp
	JML_DEV_BASE=$HOME source ~/bin/jml-sourceme.sh
	cvs -q update -d -P
	make INSTALLTYPE=cygwin local-install

  or on Linux (refine):

     become root:
       su
     then
        HOME=/home/leavens
        cd $HOME/JML2
	TEMP=$HOME/temp
	JML_DEV_BASE=$HOME source $HOME/bin/jml-sourceme.sh
	test -L /usr/local/JML && rm -f /usr/local/JML
	make INSTALLTYPE=unix local-install
	bin/Install-JML-Scripts
	chown -R leavens /usr/local/JML /usr/local/bin/jml* /usr/local/man/man1/jml*
	exit

  and then test as follows (for both):

        sync
	CLASSPATH="."
        pushd /usr/local/JML/org/jmlspecs/samples/sets
	echo "Checking sets with jml"
	jml -Q --excludefiles '_JML_Test[\044.]|TestSuite\.[^.]+' -R .
	echo "Checking sets with jmlc"
	jmlc -Q `ls *.java |sed -e '/_JML_/d;/TestSuite.java/d'`
	cd ../../models/
	echo "Checking models"
	CLASSPATH="."
	jml -Q --excludefiles '_JML_Test[\044.]|TestSuite\.[^.]+' -R .
	popd

   the following seems to give an error that it can't find
   java.util.regexp.

	cd ~/temp
	echo "Checking outside of the JML hierarchy"
	TESTOUTOFPACKAGEFILE='UnboundedStack.java'
	sed -e '/^package.*/d' /usr/local/JML/org/jmlspecs/samples/stacks/$TESTOUTOFPACKAGEFILE > $TESTOUTOFPACKAGEFILE
	CLASSPATH="."
	jml -Q $TESTOUTOFPACKAGEFILE
	jmlc -Q $TESTOUTOFPACKAGEFILE
	rm -f $TESTOUTOFPACKAGEFILE *.class

* Assuming that works, 
  if you were working on the PC, then send it to refine and do the
  linux part above: 

        cd ~/temp
	scp -pq JML.*.tar.gz refine.eecs.ucf.edu:/home/leavens/temp/

* Install it as JML-release on jmlspecs.org (from refine):

	ssh monroe.cs.ucf.edu rm -fr /home/leavens/WWW/JML-release && scp -prq /usr/local/JML monroe.cs.ucf.edu:/home/leavens/WWW/JML-release && echo done

* To actually make the release available to the world,
  do the following:

	cd ~/JML2
	source bin-for-developers/jml-temp-sourceme-unix.sh
        make release

* Check on the OldReleases directory

	ssh monroe.cs.ucf.edu ls -l $HOME/WWW/JML/OldReleases

* Make and publish the documents, by doing

	JML_DEV_BASE=$HOME source ~/bin/jml-sourceme.sh
        cd ~/JML2/docs
	make publish

* Go to SourceForge.net's JML project page and then its admin page.
  Then from the second navigation list, click on "File Releases".
  Create the release, then from the next page,
  enter the release number as the name of the release.  Make a
  highlights.txt file for the highlights of the release, and edit the
  NEWS.txt file to make a changelog for this release, and upload that
  for step 1.  Then upload the file to upload.sourceforge.net in the
  incoming directory.  Save that as step 2.  Fill out the rest of the
  form and notify people monitoring it.

* From the JML project page on sourceforge.net, also submit a news
  item announcing the release.

* To clean up the temporary directory do the following.

	cd ~/JML2
	JML_DEV_BASE=$HOME source ~/bin/jml-sourceme.sh
	TEMP=~/temp
	make archive-release
	rm -f ~/temp/jmldocs.tar.gz
	cd ~/jml-releases
	send
	cd ~/JML2

* Check on the JML web page to see if it needs updating (e.g., version
  of the Preliminary Design Document).

	emacs ~/WWW/JML/documentation.shtml

  If you had to update versions, also update the bib files

	emacs ~/include/se.bib ~/include/leavens.bib

* Now send out email to jmlspecs-releases@lists.sourceforge.net.

* Set the "version" of the TOOLS back to "from CVS after" the release.

	emacs org/jmlspecs/checker/JmlVersionOptions.opt
